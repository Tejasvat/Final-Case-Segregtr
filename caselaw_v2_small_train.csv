JUDGMENT
Introduction and Background
Both parties appeal against the judgment of the Small Claims Court dated 06.02.2023 which allowed the Appellant’s claim and entered judgment in his favour for the following:
Pre-accident value – Kshs. 455,000.00
Assessment report charges – Kshs. 5,000.00
Towing expenses – Kshs. 6,000.00
Alternative transportation expenses – Kshs.75.000.00
Storage Costs – Kshs. 15,000.00
Total Kshs. 556,000.00
Costs of the claim 
Interest from the date of filing until paid in full 
The facts giving rise to the claim were largely common cause. On 30.05.2022, the Appellant took out a comprehensive insurance policy cover with the Respondent (“the policy”) for his motor vehicle registration number K** **6Q (“the motor vehicle”). The policy was to run for a period between 30.05.2022 and 29.05.2023 and was for an insured assessed value of Kshs. 750,000.00.",Otury_v_Directline_Assurance_Company_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E137 & E140 of 2023_(Consolidated))_[2023] KEHC 25379 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
96d728cba368-1,"In a Statement of Claim dated 28.10.2022, the Appellant stated that on 10.06.2022, the motor vehicle was involved in a road traffic accident along Muranga-Thika Road resulting in extensive damages to the motor vehicle. The scene of the accident was attended to by a police officer who supervised the towing of the motor vehicle to Pangani Police Station where the Appellant duly reported the accident. 
The Appellant proceeded to notify the Respondent of the accident as required by the policy. He supplied all the supporting documents to enable the Respondent process his claim. While the Respondent was processing the claim, the Appellant learnt that it had instructed insurance investigators and loss assessors to investigate, assess and authenticate the claim. He co-operated with the investigators in establishing the circumstances of the accident. 
The Appellant averred that upon conclusion of the investigations, the Respondent declined to settle the claim citing “vague, unsubstantiated and concocted reasons”. The Appellant accused it of breach of the policy contract and thus claimed the repair costs, towing expenses, assessment report costs, alternate transport expenses and garage storage costs totaling Kshs. 803,740.00.
The Respondent filed its defence and urged the court to dismiss the claim. It stated that the policy was subject to strict adherence of the express and/or implied terms by the Appellant and any indemnity if any was subject to the terms and conditions of the policy. It averred that it could not be faulted for conducting its due diligence in investigating the claim and that the Appellant was kept informed throughout the investigations.
The Respondent stated that its investigator in its report dated 12.08.2022 concluded that the Appellant’s submission that the accident was reportedly caused by a distraction of an unknown pedestrian was unsubstantiated and not captured in the police records. That the damage incurred on the motor vehicle compared with the scene’s features were inconsistent with the circumstances of the accident as narrated by the Appellant, that prior to the policy’s commencement, there was a botched attempt by the Appellant to cover the motor vehicle with General Accident Insurance as evident in the Appellant’s call records and that the motor vehicle was brought to the accident scene already damaged.",Otury_v_Directline_Assurance_Company_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E137 & E140 of 2023_(Consolidated))_[2023] KEHC 25379 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
96d728cba368-2,"The Respondent stated that it was an express term in the policy that the Appellant would lose any rights under the policy if it is found that the Appellant made a fraudulent claim or that the Appellant or any person acting on the Respondent’s behalf misrepresented facts or information relating to a claim. That the Respondent informed the Appellant that he had misrepresented material information when reporting the claim and the Respondent admitted that it indeed declined the claim through its letter of 23.08.2022. Thus, the Respondent asserted that it declined to admit the Appellant’s claim on grounds that the Appellant misrepresented and/or concealed material facts when reporting the claim which was a clear breach of the principle of utmost good faith and breach of the policy. 
The parties agreed to proceed and dispose of the matter by way of documents and written submissions. The Adjudicator rendered a judgment on 06.02.2023. She identified two issues for determination; whether the Respondent was justified in declining the claim and whether the Appellant was entitled to the reliefs sought. On the first issue, the Adjudicator found that the Respondent did not go beyond setting out its suspicion and failed to provide and alternative set of facts and stopped at only stating that the accident did not happen in the manner narrated by the Appellant. That the Respondent neither claimed nor proved any material non-disclosure on the Appellant’s part before the conclusion of the policy contract. The Adjudicator therefore concluded that the Respondent’s defence was a mere denial and that there was no justification to decline the claim and as such, the Respondent was in breach of the policy.",Otury_v_Directline_Assurance_Company_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E137 & E140 of 2023_(Consolidated))_[2023] KEHC 25379 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
96d728cba368-3,"On the reliefs sought by the Appellant, the Adjudicator considered the assessment reports filed by both parties and concluded that it would not make any economic sense to repair the vehicle hence the Appellant was entitled to the pre-accident value of the motor vehicle less the salvage value. The Adjudicator arrived at a figure of Kshs, 655,000.00 as the pre-accident value based on the different pre-accident values of Kshs. 725,000.00 and Kshs. 585,000.00. As for the salvage value, the Adjudicator noted that there was no such indication in the report prepared by the Respondent and it thus went with the salvage value prepared by the Nordics Assessors which placed it at Kshs. 200,000.00. The court awarded Kshs. 455,000.00 under this head after reducing the pre-accident value of Kshs. 655,000.00 by the salvage value of Kshs. 200,000.00. 
The Adjudicator held that the Appellant had proved the assessment and towing charges amounting to Kshs. 5,000.00 and Kshs. 6,000.00 respectively. The Adjudicator declined the full claim for the cost of alternative transportation which was in the nature of loss of user on the ground that the claim was not reasonable and the Appellant had a duty to mitigate his loss. Further, that it was not probable that the Appellant used a cab every day to work for a total of 74 days noting that advocates do not work every day of the week. Thus, the court awarded Kshs, 75,000,00 transportation costs based on 30 days at a rate of Kshs. 2,500.00 per day. The court applied this reasoning to award Kshs. 15,000.00 storage costs for 30 days at a rate of Kshs. 500.00. 
It is for the above reasons that the Subordinate Court entered judgment for the amount set out in Para.1 above. This is the decision that triggered the appeals by both parties. The parties filed written submission in support of the positions in the consolidated appeals. 
Analysis and Determination",Otury_v_Directline_Assurance_Company_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E137 & E140 of 2023_(Consolidated))_[2023] KEHC 25379 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
96d728cba368-4,"Analysis and Determination  
The court’s jurisdiction in dealing with appeals from the Small Claims Court is limited by section 38(1) of the Small Claims Court Act, 2016 which provides that ‘A person aggrieved by the decision or an order of the Court may appeal against that decision or order to the High Court on matters of law.’A court limited to matters of law is not permitted to substitute the subordinate court’s decision with its own conclusions based on its own analysis and appreciation of the facts unless the findings are so perverse that no reasonable tribunal would have arrived at them (John Munuve Mati v Returning Officer Mwingi North Constituency & 2 others [2018] eKLR).
The Respondent appeals against the entire judgment while the Appellant appeals against the damages awarded as he claimed to have specifically pleaded and proved each claim; all the cost of repairs, towing expenses, alternative transportation expenses and garage storage charges. All in all, the parties are inviting the court to interrogate whether the Subordinate Court’s findings are perverse and whether any reasonable court directing itself on the matter would have arrived at the same decision as the Adjudicator. 
The Respondent’s case is that it proved that Appellant had misrepresented and/or concealed material facts when reporting the claim which was a clear breach of the principle of utmost good faith and breach of the policy. It is common ground that the Respondent arrived at this decision based on the report dated 12.08.2022 from its investigators, Parity Loss Assessors & Consultants Limited. As stated, the parties agreed to dispose of the matter by way of documents, thus it was not expected that the author of the report would testify as to how they arrived at the said conclusions. All the Adjudicator could do, was to weigh the pleadings and documents on record and make a determination based on which of them held more sway than the other.",Otury_v_Directline_Assurance_Company_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E137 & E140 of 2023_(Consolidated))_[2023] KEHC 25379 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
96d728cba368-5,"The Respondent relied on the said investigator’s report dated 12.08.2022 while the Appellant supported its case with 13 documents including a copy of the motor vehicle’s logbook, the policy document and schedule, Mpesa excerpts showing payment of the premium, the police abstract, the motor vehicle’s accident report and claim intimation form, the disclaimer letter dated 23.08.2022 from the Respondent, assessment reports from Leone Motor Assessors and Nordics Auto Assessors, receipts, car hire agreement from Toffy Touch Investment, Letter from Murgweng Enterprises Garage dated 12.08.2022 and the demand letter before action dated 18.10.2022. 
Based on the material before the court, I agree with the Adjudicator that there was little or no dispute by the Respondent that the accident indeed happened and if at all there was such a dispute, the police abstract confirmed the accident. Even the Respondent’s investigator did not dispute the occurrence of the accident. What the Respondent seemed to be disputing was how the accident occurred and the damage sustained by the motor vehicle. 
The totality of the evidence supported the conclusions of the Adjudicator that the Respondent’s case was based on suspicion, conjecture and subjective opinions of the investigators rather than facts showing how the accident occurred and the damage on the motor vehicle, were inconsistent with the Appellant’s version of events. On the part of the Appellant, his statements to the Respondent and investigators was consistent with the available evidence including the photographs attached to the Assessment reports which corroborate the Appellant’s claim that the motor vehicle sustained damages as a result of the accident. I find and hold that the Adjudicator did not err in concluding that the Respondent had failed to prove its case.",Otury_v_Directline_Assurance_Company_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E137 & E140 of 2023_(Consolidated))_[2023] KEHC 25379 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
96d728cba368-6,"As regards the Appellant’s case, the Adjudicator cited Virani t/a Kisumu Beach Resort v Phoenix of East Africa Assurance Company Ltd [2004] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held that a claim for special damages should not only be pleaded but strictly proved. The Appellant claimed assessed repair costs of the motor vehicle of Kshs. 523,740.00, towing expenses of Kshs. 22,000.00, assessment report costs of Kshs. 5,000.00, alternative transport expenses of Kshs. 185,000.00 and garage storage charges of Kshs. 68,000.00. The Appellant was thus required to demonstrate that he incurred these expenses by adducing evidence proving that he made payments for the same. On the assessed repair costs, the Appellant relied on the assessment given in the report by Nordics Auto Assessors which gave repair estimates of Kshs. 523,740.00. There was nothing to show that the motor vehicle was repaired or that the Appellant expended this sum as repair costs. It is a well settled principle of law that an invoice is not proof of payment and that special damages can only be proved by producing actual receipts or invoices endorsed with the word “Paid” (see Total (Kenya) Limited Formally Caltex Oil (Kenya) Limited v Janevams Limited [2015] eKLR and Guardian Coach Ltd & another v Kiptoo (Civil Appeal 34 of 2020) [2022] KEHC 12397 (KLR) (26 May 2022) (Judgment)). This claim was therefore not proved and I find that the learned Adjudicator erred in awarding this sum based on assessed estimated costs rather than actual receipts or other evidence as proof of payment for any such repair costs. The Respondent’s appeal therefore succeeds on this ground.",Otury_v_Directline_Assurance_Company_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E137 & E140 of 2023_(Consolidated))_[2023] KEHC 25379 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
96d728cba368-7,"On towing expenses, I agree with the Learned Adjudicator that even though the Appellant sought Kshs. 22,000.00, what was proved by way of an invoice endorsed with the word “paid” was Kshs. 6,000.00. I further agree that the Appellant proved the payment of Kshs. 5,000.00 for the assessment report by adducing a receipt for the same. On the alternative transport expenses of Kshs. 185,000.00, I note that the Appellant produced a receipt for the said sum. However, the Adjudicator rejected this claim and her reason for rejecting it on the ground that, “advocates do not work every day of the week,” is not a matter that the court could take judicial notice and was not supported by any evidence. The Appellant’s receipt was sufficient to prove his claim that he spent alternative transport expenses of Kshs. 185,000.00. In any case, the Respondent did not rebut this figure by proving that the Appellant could not have spent this amount. The award of Kshs. 75,000.00 was therefore without basis and is set aside. 
The Appellant did not produce any evidence of payment for garage storage charges. What is on record is a demand letter by the garage to the Appellant seeking this amount. As I have stated, a demand for payment is not proof of payment and therefore the Appellant did not prove that he had expended any sums on storage charges. This ground of appeal by the Respondent succeeds and the Adjudicator’s award of Kshs. 15,000.00 is set aside. 
Disposition 
For the above reasons, I find that both appeals partly succeed. In the circumstances, each party shall bear its own costs of the appeal.
The judgment of the Subordinate Court dated 06.02.2023 is set aside and substituted with the following judgment entered for the Appellant against the Respondent for:
Kshs. 196,000.00 made up as follows:
Assessment report charges – Kshs. 5,000.00
Towing expenses – Kshs. 6,000.00
Alternative transportation expenses – Kshs.185.000.00

This cause is non contentious as all the parties are in agreement with the distribution of the estate and have provided proposed modes of distribution. The 1st and 2nd Administrators filed their affidavit on the proposed mode of distribution on 11th September 2023 whereas the 3rd administrator filed hers on 14th November 2023.
Article 27 of the Constitution of Kenya provides as follows;
27. Equality and freedom from discrimination
(1) Every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law.
Section 38 of the Law of Succession Act provides as follows;
Where an intestate has left a surviving child or children but no spouse, the net intestate estate shall, subject to the provisions of sections 41 and 42, devolve upon the surviving child, if there be only one, or shall be equally divided among the surviving children.
Guided by the legal principles espoused in the statutes above and upon considering the affidavits on record and the proposed modes of distribution I hereby order that the estate of the deceased shall be distributed as follows;
Whereas the parties have agreed on the distribution, something must be said about the contentions Kshs. 30,000,000/- that was withdrawn for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the estate under mysterious circumstances. Section 55 of the Law of Succession Act states as follows;
(1) No grant of representation, whether or not limited in its terms, shall confer power to distribute any capital assets constituting a net estate, or to make any division of property, unless and until the grant has been confirmed as provided by section 71.
(2) The restriction on distribution under subsection (1) does not apply to the distribution or application before the grant of representation is confirmed of any income arising from the estate and received after the date of death whether the income arises in respect of a period wholly or partly before or after the date of death.",In_re_Estate_of_Jan_Chris_Esselink_(Deceased)_(Succession_Cause_66 of 2020)_[2023] KEHC 25439 (KLR)_(20 November 2023)_(Judgment)
afd74ef06bb1-2,"Further, as the withdrawal was instigated by one of the administrators, it is imperative that this court emphasize the  duties of administrators as was set out in section 83 of the Law of Succession Act as follows;
83. Personal representatives shall have the following duties-
(a) to provide and pay, out of the estate of the deceased, the expenses of a reasonable funeral for him; 
(b) to get in all free property of the deceased, including debts owing to him and moneys payable to his personal representatives by reason of his death;
(c) to pay, out of the estate of the deceased, all expenses of obtaining their grant of representation, and all other reasonable expenses of administration (including estate duty, if any);
(d) to ascertain and pay, out of the estate of the deceased, all his debts;
(e) within six months from the date of the grant, to produce to the court a full and accurate inventory of the assets and liabilities of the deceased and a full and accurate account of all dealings therewith up to the date of the account;
(f) subject to section 55, to distribute or to retain on trust (as the case may require) all assets remaining after payment of expenses and debts as provided by the preceding paragraphs of this section and the income therefrom, according to the respective beneficial interests therein under the will or on intestacy, as the case may be;
(g) within six months from the date of confirmation of the grant, or such longer period as the court may allow, to complete the administration of the estate in respect of all matters other than continuing trusts, and to produce to the court a full and accurate account of the completed administration.
(h) to produce to the court, if required by the court, either of its own motion or on the application of any interested party in the estate, a full and accurate inventory of the assets and liabilities of the deceased and a full and accurate account of all dealings therewith up to the date of the account;
(i) to complete the administration of the estate in respect of all matters other than continuing trusts and if required by the court, either of its own motion or on the application of any interested party in the estate, to produce to the court a full and accurate account of the completed administration.",In_re_Estate_of_Jan_Chris_Esselink_(Deceased)_(Succession_Cause_66 of 2020)_[2023] KEHC 25439 (KLR)_(20 November 2023)_(Judgment)
afd74ef06bb1-3,"In this cause there are three administrators and therefore, any decisions made with regards to the estate must have the input of all three administrators. It is apparent that the withdrawal of funds for the alleged purpose of defraying the expenses of the estate was at the instruction of one administrator and therefore there was no concurrence among the administrators. It is my considered view that this was in contravention of section 55 of the Law of Succession Act. However, I take note that the parties have since reached a resolution on how to settle this particular issue by distributing the balance of the sums equally amongst themselves upon recovery of the same and therefore there is no further dispute or contention as to the distribution of the estate.
The estate shall be distributed as stated above and the administrators are to render accounts within six months in order for the cause to be marked as closed.
It is so ordered.

MISC APPLICATION NO.     E109    OF 2018
MARTIN KHAEMBA WEKANYWA-------------------------------APPLICANT
VERSUS
WAMALWA SIMIYU & CO ADVOCATES-------------------RESPONDENT
RULING
The application before me is a notice of motion brought under certificate of urgency dated 7th February, 2023 and amended on 21st March,2023, pursuant to Article 40 of the constitution, section 3A of the Civil Procedure Act, Order 40 Rules 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10, Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules  seeking the following orders;
Spent
Spent 
That pending the hearing of and determination of the application the court be pleased to order the summoning of the court process server one David Imo for purposes of being cross-examined by the applicant’s counsel.
That pending the hearing of the suit inter-partes, the Court be pleased to issue an order compelling the 1st respondent from harassing the Applicant.
The costs of the application be borne by the Respondent.
The same is supported by an affidavit sworn by the Applicant who averred inter alia; that the Respondent through a firm of Auctioneers have been harassing him intending to execute a decree dated 26th October,2022 which emanated from an application dated 10th May,2019 whose service is highly disputed; that he stands to suffer irreparable damage if the court does not intervene; that he seeks to be granted  a chance to defend himself as he was not given an opportunity due to falsehoods of the process server.
The Respondent in opposition averred that the Applicant was duly served with the court documents as he was represented by his advocate on record; that the Auctioneer is immune to the proceedings by virtue of section 6 of the Judicature Act as it was executing lawful warrants which have not been challenged, recalled or set aside; that there is no illegality attributed to the Auctioneer and thus the application is an abuse of the court process  and which should be dismissed.",Wekanywa_v_Wamalwa_Simiyu_&_Co_Advocates_(Miscellaneous_Application_E109 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25424 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
233d13370baa-1,"In their submissions dated 25th August,2023 the Respondent submitted that the orders as sought by the Applicants were against the court which is mandated to execute its decrees. Reliance was placed in the case of Michael Bartenge vs. Stephen Bartenge (2007) Eklr. Counsel submitted that the Applicant ought to have sought for stay orders and setting aside of the impugned decree since the calling of a process server for the purposes of cross examination would not have any effect and would be engaging the court in an academic exercise unless the decree is stayed/lifted.
I have considered the application and submissions. The history of the matter is that the Respondent filed an advocate-client bill of costs dated 24th June,2018 which was taxed off at Kshs.145,234/= and a certificate of costs issued on 22nd March,2019. The Respondent thereafter filed an application dated 10th May,2019 seeking to have the certificate of costs converted to a decree for purposes of execution. The application was allowed in the absence of the Applicant herein on 26th October,2022 after the court satisfied itself of service of the application upon the Applicant herein. As a result, the Respondent herein proceeded to execute the decree.  I find that the issue for determination is whether the applicant is entitled to the reliefs sought. 
The Applicant in his application sought for orders that the application be certified as urgent and for orders restraining the Respondent from auctioning his property which orders were granted in the interim. Further, the Applicant sought for an order summoning the Court process server for purposes of cross-examination pending hearing and determination of the application which order was not granted in the interim. The last two prayers were orders restraining the respondent from harassing the Applicant and a prayer for costs.
It is clear from the foregoing prayers that the Applicant is not seeking any orders beyond the inter parties hearing stage. Put differently, the applicant is not seeking any order to preserve any property or threatened legal or equitable right pending the hearing and determination of the instant application. I am aware that disputes will always arise during the execution stage in any litigation, but in the instant application none has been disclosed.
In Re Estate of Bakari Marakweli Mwakwisha (deceased) (2008) eKLR it was held:",Wekanywa_v_Wamalwa_Simiyu_&_Co_Advocates_(Miscellaneous_Application_E109 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25424 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
233d13370baa-2,"“I am afraid the applicant did not seek any orders which may be granted.  His only substantive prayer was for the grant of an interlocutory injunction pending the hearing and determination of this application.  That order was granted at the time when the application was certified urgent.  It was to be in force pending the hearing and determination of the application.  Once the application is heard and determined, that order will have served its purpose, and there will be nothing more to be done.  Strictly speaking, indeed, there is no prayer to be heard.  The applicant ought to have included a prayer for an injunction pending the hearing and determination of the petition for the grant of letters of administration intestate.  But such injunction was not applied for, and the court cannot grant an order which is not prayed for.”
Even looking at the “orders” as sought without a substantive prayer, the application is misconceived and incompetent as any relief sought can only be granted if there is pending a substantive prayer, and that there is not one such in this application. Even so the prayer for orders restraining the Respondents from harassing the Applicant has not been substantiated. Clearly, the application is devoid of the requisite prayers which could act as an anchor. As it is, the orders sought are only ideal at the ex-parte stage but not the next stage as the same will have become spent. If that is the position, then there is nothing substantive for this court’s deliberation. As framed by the applicant, the orders are to subsist until the determination of the application interpartes. The applicant must be informed that we are now at the interpartes hearing stage and that the orders sought are deemed to have served the purpose and as such there is nothing that the court can deliberate upon. Again, it is noted that the application stems from an execution of decree process. As the applicant has not sought for an order of stay of execution of the decree, it is untenable to stop the executioner from carrying out its lawful duties. I find the prayers are not capable of being granted and that if the same is granted, the next question facing the applicant will be ‘’what next?’’
In view of the foregoing observations, I come to the finding that the application is devoid of merit. The same is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.
It is so ordered.

- VERSUS -
SECUREX AGENCIES (K) LTD ■………….RESPONDENT
(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the Memorandum of claim on 10.12.2018 through S.J Nyang & Co Advocates. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
An order compelling the respondent to pay the claimant his terminal dues and salary in lieu of notice all totalling to Kshs.340,087.00.
General damages for mental torture, stress anguish as a result of loss of employment. 
Reinstatement to employment together with withheld salary to date.
Costs of the claim and interest on (a) and (b) above at commercial rates. 
Or in the alternative payment of withheld salaries together with orders (a,b&c). 
The reply to claim was filed on 04.04.2019 through Simiyu Wekesa Advocates. The respondent prayed that the claimant’s suit against it be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant’s case was that he was an employee of the respondent from 02.02.2013 until 18.12.2015 when without reasonable justification, the respondent casually terminated his services without notice. 
That on 11.06.2015, the Kenya Power & Lighting Company through their employees or representatives made a malicious complaint to the Muthaiga Police Station to the effect that the claimant together with others had stolen a 22KVA transformer serial no. 1256438 at the Ruaraka Kenya power complex contrary to section 268 as read with section 275 of the Penal Code and later arraigned in court on the 18.06.2015 in criminal case no. 1925 of 2015 at Makadara law courts, Nairobi.
The claimant was tried before the Principal Magistrate’s Court at Makadara Law Courts where after lengthy trial the claimant was acquitted under section 210 of the criminal procedure code.",Emira_v_Securex_Agencies_(K)_Ltd_(Cause_1596 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2940 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
e3807440c46b-1,"It is the claimant’s case that the respondent did not procedurally terminate his employment. Instead, it relied and focused on the allegations of theft, which allegations caused the claimant to be put in custody for some days, during which, he was alleged to have deserted duty and his services summarily terminated without giving him a fair hearing.  
The claimant stated that on 17.06.2015 he received a report from the main office of the respondent instructing him to inform his night shift colleagues not to leave the assignment the next day, 18.06.2015. 
That KPLC sent police officers to arrest the claimant and two of his colleagues Daniel Ouma and Peter Natembea. The police did not arrest the rest of the claimant’s colleagues who were twenty-seven in number. The claimant and his colleagues were held at Industrial Area Prisons, and the claimant was bailed out on 26.06.2015 by his uncle. 
The claimant pleaded that on 29.06.2015 he went to the respondent’s base office seeking to resume work, but, he was given a notice to report back to the base office on 02.07.2015 for a hearing. 
That on 02.07.2015 the claimant went to the respondent’s base office as instructed and met his colleague Peter Natembea who had equally been notified to attend a hearing on same day. That after 3 hours of waiting, they were informed that their area manager one Mr. Nderutu was not available and that they should leave and return on 07.07.2015. 
On 07.07.2015 the claimant arrived at the respondent’s offices at 0820 Hrs. He met discovered that his colleague Peter Natembea had already arrived. They were the informed that Mr. Nderutu, the human resource manager, operations and shop stewards were in a meeting, and that they should wait. 
When the meeting ended, Mr. Nderutu informed the claimant that he had to attend to an emergency in the field. Some of the shop stewards approached the claimant and Peter Natembea, and tried to convince them to write resignation letters so that they get paid quickly like their colleague Daniel Ouma.",Emira_v_Securex_Agencies_(K)_Ltd_(Cause_1596 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2940 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
e3807440c46b-2,"The claimant and his colleague declined to write the resignation letters, and were informed to return to the respondent’s offices on 08.07.2015. 
On 08.07.2015 the claimant returned to the respondent’s offices. Mr. Nderutu was not available and thus the meeting could not take place. The respondent’s secretary asked the claimant to leave his contacts behind, which he states, he wrote down on a piece of paper. 
The claimant states that he fundraised amongst his friends and used the monies to relocate, together with his family, back to his home in Busia County. 
That on 11.01.2016 he returned to Nairobi purposely to collect his school certificates which were in the custody of the respondent. That he was requested to return the respondent’s property before being given his certificates, which he states he did on 12.01.2016. On the same date his certificates were handed over to him together with a certificate of service and a cheque for the days he had worked in the month of June 2015. 
On the part of the respondent, it admitted that the claimant was its employee, employed as a security guard effective 01.05.2011 to 30.06.2015 earning a basic salary of Kshs.12,221/= and a house allowance of Kshs.1,833.17/=. 
That on 09.06.2015 the claimant was assigned duties at Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) Ruaraka grounds. While on duty at the site, the claimant failed  to raise alarm or report vandalism of a transformer that occurred at KPLC Ruaraka grounds which was discovered the following day on 10.06.2015. 
The claimant was summoned by the respondent on the events that led to the transformer being vandalized and he prepared a written statement on his observations in relation to the security breach at KPLC Ruaraka grounds. 
The respondent stated that the claimant’s actions of failing to raise alarm of the theft resulted in him being issued with a notice to show cause on 29.06.2015. He was required to attend a disciplinary hearing on 02.07.2015.",Emira_v_Securex_Agencies_(K)_Ltd_(Cause_1596 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2940 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
e3807440c46b-3,"The claimant did not show up for the disciplinary hearing on 02.07.2015 and no reason was given for the absence. The claimant having failed to appear for disciplinary proceedings and having been absent from duty without authority, the respondent summarily dismissed him. 
The respondent stated that the claimant showed up at the respondent’s premises on 13.01.2016 to collect his terminal dues. However, he did not offer an explanation on his whereabouts for the six months that he was absent from employment. 
The respondent paid his final dues and issued him a certificate of service. 
The Claimant filed his submissions. Despite service the respondent failed to attend at the hearing and failed to file final submissions. The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
To answer the 1st issue, there is no dispute that the parties were in a contract of service.
The 2nd issue is whether the contract of service was terminated. The respondent states that a notice to show cause was issued on 29.06.2015 for a disciplinary hearing on 02.07.2015. Further, that the claimant failed to show at the disciplinary hearing and resurfaced on 13.01.2016 to collect his terminal dues. The claimant’s account is that he received the notice to report back on 02.07.2015 but the hearing was adjourned to 07.07.2015. the claimant stated that on 07.07.2015 the Human Resource Manager for the second time was very busy to meet him and the shop steward who had been in a meeting with the Manager asked him to resign like his co-accused Daniel Ouma had done so as to be paid the worked days. He declined and was asked to go back on 08.07.2015 when the meeting could not take place but the secretary for the Manager asked her to record his address and to go home to be called later. He testified he never received the call until 15.07.2015 when it became unsustainable as he could no longer pay the rent and he did the fundraiser and travelled to his rural home in Busia. He came back to Nairobi on 11.01.2016, handed over and received the final cheque for days worked.",Emira_v_Securex_Agencies_(K)_Ltd_(Cause_1596 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2940 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
e3807440c46b-4,"The Court finds that the claimant’s account upon his own testimony is not challenged at all. It was for the respondent to show that on 02.07.2015 the claimant had failed to attend the disciplinary hearing as envisaged in section 43 of the Employment Act. If indeed the claimant had failed to do so, it is not clear why the same could not be revived in January 2016 when the claimant showed up. Instead it appears the respondent decided to give a final pay cheque without reference to the disciplinary process. The Court finds that the respondent frustrated the disciplinary hearing. The Court finds that the procedure adopted was not fair as per section 41 of the Act. The disciplinary procedure having aborted at the instance of the respondent, it cannot be said that there was established reason for the termination as envisaged in section 43 of the Act. It was unfair in substance and procedure. The submissions made for the claimant are upheld. The claimant exhibits a letter dated 9.08.2018 addressed to his advocate by the respondent stating that the claimant was declared a deserter 18.12.2015 after receiving the letter to show cause dated 29.06.2015 and failing to attend a disciplinary hearing on 02.07.2015. Once again, the respondent fails to explain why the letter on desertion was not issued promptly on 02.07.2015, once again rendering the respondent’s account not probable on a balance of probability.
The 3rd issue is on remedies. The Court finds as follows:
The claimant was dismissed when the disciplinary process aborted at the respondent’s instance and it was without notice as he is awarded Kshs.22,000.00 in lieu of notice.
The court has considered the factors in section 12 of the Act. The aggravating factors are that the respondent failed to conclude the disciplinary process and subjected the claimant to unjustified adjournments. The Court has considered the period served and also considered the claimant otherwise had a clean record of service. He is awarded 8 months’ salaries in compensation making Kshs.176,000.00. 
There appears no material on record shows the claimant was a member of NSSF and the claim for service pay is declined.",Emira_v_Securex_Agencies_(K)_Ltd_(Cause_1596 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2940 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
e3807440c46b-5,"The Court has considered the suffering the claimant went through for the manner he was dismissed and awarded 8 months’ salaries in compensation. The claimant has not shown justification for general damages for mental torture, stress and anguish as a separate heading for award. It is declined. There were no submissions made in that regard to justify the award. The submissions made for payment of withheld salaries are found baseless as no claim and prayer had been made in that regard. No submissions were made on the prayer for reinstatement and the same is deemed abandoned and correctly so as it was already statute barred, three years having lapsed from the date of the termination. The termination having been constructive effective 02.07.2015 when the disciplinary process aborted.
The claimant has succeeded and the respondent will pay costs.
In conclusion judgment is hereby entered for the claimant against the respondent for:
Payment of Kshs.198,000.00 by 31.12.2023 failing interest to be payable thereon at Court rates from the date of this judgment till full payment.
The respondent to pay costs of the suit.

Be paid a one (1) month’s salary in lieu of notice, 12 months’ pay for unlawful termination and payment of all outstanding dues and benefits from the date of unlawful termination thereof as follows or as the court deems fit and just in the circumstances;

That the applicant be granted leave to amend its petition as set out in the draft amended petitioner/applicant annexed thereto. 
That the draft amended petition attached to the application be deemed as duly filed and served upon payment of requisite court fees. 
Costs be in the cause. 
The Respondent/Applicant has in reply filed a preliminary objection dated 25.10.2023. 
The preliminary objection was made upon the following grounds:
The Honourable Court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition by virtue of the claim being time-barred pursuant to section 3(2) of the Public Authorities Limitations Act, Cap 39, Laws of Kenya.
That the petitioner is attempting to circumvent the law on limitation of actions by relying on the constitutional provisions having realized that the matter is statute barred under the parent Acts which give effect to constitutional rights. 
That the petition is an abuse of court process 
That the petition is incompetent, bad in law, mala fides and ought to be struck out with costs. 
The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
The petitioner was terminated from the 1st respondent’s service on 08.02.2011. He had been charged in criminal case No. 434 0f 2011 and acquitted on 03.07.2015 and he says he instructed Ombeta & Associates to file suit for malicious prosecution and unfair termination but failed to afford the legal fees for the services. It appears that the only reason the petitioner is moving the Court belatedly is because he did not have fees to pursue the matter. The Court considers the reason advanced not to be plausible especially that the said instructions to counsel appear to have been at a time when the time of limitation as urged for the respondent had long lapsed. The Court finds that the cause of action is time barred as urged for the respondent and the petition is an abuse of Court Process.
In conclusion the notice of preliminary objection dated 25.10.2023 is hereby upheld and the petition herein dismissed with no orders on costs.

(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the Statement of claim on 12.06.2017 through Mbigi Njuguna & Co Advocates. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
Severance pay (15 days salary per month× 10 years worked) = Kshs.194,630 
Unpaid salary for 90 days (3 months) Kshs.38,926 ×3 months =116, 778 
Notice (3 months’ salary) Kshs.38,926 ×3 months = Kshs.116,778.00.
Costs of the suit. 
The Memorandum of response was filed on 24.08.2017 through Prof Albert Mumma & Co Advocates. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant’s case was that he was employed by the respondent on 11.11.2005 as a Moxy Dumper Operator earning a basic salary of Kshs.7,800 per month and a housing allowance of Kshs.1,600 per month. 
The claimant states that he was a in that position for approximately ten years from 11.11.2009 to 31.03.2015 when he was unfairly terminated vide a letter which stated that his services were no longer required. 
As at 31.03.2015 he was earning a gross salary of Kshs.38,926 with the net salary being Kshs.25,617. 
The claimant states that he was never given an opportunity to be heard and no credible reasons were given as to why his services were no longer required.",Wanyama_v_Aristocrats_Concrete_Ltd_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_1077 of 2017)_[2023] KEELRC 2945 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
fd5f76056bb2-1,"On the part of the respondent it was argued that the claimant’s letter of offer was a fixed term contract which was to subsist for 3 months each renewable over the period 11.11.2005 to 11.02.2016. 
That there was no contract capable of enforcement in law existing as at 31.03.2015 between the claimant and the respondent for the claimant to merit the monies sought. 
That there is no basis for service pay as sought. It is not provided in the employment contract between the claimant and the respondent.  Further, that there is no basis for a claim for unpaid salary for 90 days (3 months) as sought by the claimant as all monies owing to the claimant from its fixed term contract were duly paid to the claimant.
The respondent states that there is no basis for a claim for 3 months’ salary as sought because the letter of offer dated 11.11.2005 only provided for one week notice or one-week salary in lieu of notice. 
The respondent’s case was that the contract between the claimant and respondent was never renewed upon expiry. 
The Claimant filed his submissions. However, there are no submissions on record on the part of the respondent. The Court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.",Wanyama_v_Aristocrats_Concrete_Ltd_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_1077 of 2017)_[2023] KEELRC 2945 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
fd5f76056bb2-2,"To answer the 1st issue the Court returns that parties were in initially in a fixed term contract for three months. The respondent alleges the contracts were renewed over the period of relationship. Further, the respondent alleges that the last of the three-months contracts was for the term ending 31.03.2015. However, the Court finds that there are no subsequent monthly contracts exhibited. The claimant testified thus, “Last day at work was 31.03.2015. I see my exhibit No.2. Is termination letter dated 31.03.2015 effective 01.04.2015?”  The Court finds that while the initial contract was the three-months’ contract, when it lapsed there is no evidence that it was renewed. The parties are found to have been in a month to month contract of service until the respondent issued the letter of termination of services dated 31.03.2015 conveying that the claimant’s services were no longer required effective 01.04.2015 and to collect final dues on 10.04.2015.
To answer the 2nd issue, the Court finds the termination was abrupt without due notice. The claimant is awarded Kshs.38, 926.00 being one-month in lieu of notice and in view of section 35 of the Employment Act. The Court further finds that unpaid salary for 90 days was not established at all and, the 3 months’ notice pay had no contractual basis.",Wanyama_v_Aristocrats_Concrete_Ltd_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_1077 of 2017)_[2023] KEELRC 2945 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
fd5f76056bb2-3,"To answer the 3rd issue, the Court finds that the termination was unfair. The respondent has offered no evidence to show that the claimant’s services were indeed not required and the reason has not been shown to have existed as at termination as envisaged in section 43 of the Act. The claimant’s submission is upheld. If indeed his services were not required, then it amounted to redundancy per section 40 of the Act but due procedure under the section was not invoked. The Court has considered the provisions in section 40 of the Act. The claimant worked without break from 11.11.2005 to 31.03.2015. It makes 9 complete years and due severance pay would be about 5 months’ salary at half month salary. He is awarded 9 x 0.5 x 38, 926.00 for severance pay as claimed in amended claim making Kshs.175,167.00. having succeeded in his claim, the costs are granted.
In conclusion judgment is hereby entered for the claimant against the respondent for:
Payment of Kshs.214,093.00 by 31.12.2023 failing interest at Court rates be payable thereon from the date of filing the suit till full payment.
The respondent to pay costs of the suit.

d84f99db50f4-3,"The application was canvassed by way of written submissions. The applicants   filed their submissions dated 25th August 2023 while the respondents relied on their replying affidavit sworn on 20th day of July, 2023. 
I have given due consideration to the rival affidavits and submissions. I find that the issue of for determination is whether the application meets the threshold to warrant grant of an order of stay of execution pending determination of the Appellants’ appeal. 
It is trite that an application seeking stay of execution must meet the clear provisions of Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides in summary as follows:
‘’No order for stay of execution shall be made under sub rule (1) unless-
  The court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
Such security as the court may order for the due performance of such decree or order as it may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.’’
As to whether the application has been filed without undue delay, it is noted that the impugned ruling was delivered on 14/6/2023 while the Memorandum of Appeal was filed on 3/7/2023. It is thus clear that there was no inordinate delay at all on the part of the Appellant/Applicant. That condition has been met.
As regards the issue of whether the applicant will suffer substantial loss, the applicant has beseeched this court for intervention since according to them, the appeal will be rendered nugatory if orders of stay are not granted at this stage as the Respondent has already taken out warrants and is ready to execute. It is not in doubt that substantial loss does not represent any particular amount or size whether monetary or otherwise. It is sufficient that the applicant can show that the execution is likely to put into motion other state of affairs which will substantially affect the Appellant as the eventual successful party in the appeal. See James Wangalwa & Another V. Agnes Naliaka Cheseto [2020] eKLR.",Impact_Finance_Trust_CDF_Bumula_&_another_v_Kokonya_&_another_&_another_(Civil_Appeal_71 of 2023)_[2023] KEHC 25413 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
d84f99db50f4-4,"The Respondents have averred that they are persons of means and that they do farming and will be in a position to refund the decretal sums in the event of success of appeal. However, the Respondents did not go further by presenting evidence to the effect that indeed they are not persons of straw such as by availing bank statements etc. This thus bolsters the Appellants’ concerns that they are likely to have a paper judgement in the event of success of appeal as the Respondents will not be in a position to refund the monies already paid to them. I find that the Appellants have satisfied this condition.
As regards the issue of security, the Appellants have averred that they are ready and willing to provide security for the due performance of the decree and that they are ready to abide by any condition to be imposed by the court. Indeed, the Respondents are the decree holders and already on the seat of judgement and that they ought to enjoy the fruits of that judgement. If the Appellants are now seeking to stand in their way, then they must see to it that the Respondents’ concerns are taken care of. On the other hand, the Appellants are also entitled to ventilate their appeal otherwise the same might be rendered nugatory. In order to balance their rival concerns, I find that an order that the Appellants deposit the entire decretal sums into a joint interest earning account in the joint names of the Advocates for the parties pending determination of the appeal will be appropriate in the circumstances.
In the result, I find merit in the Appellants application dated 30/6/2023. The same is allowed in the following terms:
 
An order of stay of execution of the decree and all consequential orders in Bungoma CMCC No. 456 of 2016 is hereby granted upon the Appellants depositing the entire decretal amount plus assessed costs as disclosed on the warrants of attachment into a joint interest earning account in the names of both Advocates within fourteen (14) days from the date of this ruling failing which the stay shall lapse.
The costs of the application shall abide in the appeal.

(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)

c80b259dd67b-1,"The respondent be ordered to pay the costs of the claim and interest. 
The Memorandum of defence was filed on 15.09.2021 through Ronn Law Advocates LLP. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant’s case was that he was employed by the respondent as a supply chain manager vide a letter of employment 21.12.2010. 
That he served the respondent company with diligence and as a result was promoted to the position of supply chain director with effect from 09.12.2016. 
That on 25.04.2019 the claimant signed a salary review memorandum dated 24.04.2019 which stated that with effect from 01.04.2019 the claimant’s basic salary would be Kshs.426,368.25. 
That for the ten years that the claimant served the respondent, no complaint was raised about his performance. 
On 15.03.2021 the claimant received a letter suspending his employment for alleged breach of terms and conditions of his contract and the company’s code of conduct. 
The claimant states that he replied to said letter, through his letter dated 17.03.2021, informing the respondent of the need to specify the acts by the claimants or conduct which amounted to the alleged breaches. 
In a letter dated 24.03.2021 the respondent requested the claimant so show cause why the company should not take disciplinary action against him. 
Through a letter dated 27.03.2021 the claimant states that he responded to the respondent’s show cause letter addressing each allegation. 
By a letter dated 03.03.2021 the respondent invited the claimant to attend a disciplinary hearing on 31.03.2021, to which the claimant honoured the invitation and attended the hearing. 
The claimant contends that the disciplinary hearing was not carried out in accordance with fair labour practices, and was unfair for reasons that he was not informed of the particular charges he was facing, prior to the meeting. 
The claimant pleaded that he followed all company procedures while discharging his duties as supply chain director and that he acted in good faith while discharging said duties.",Inyani_v_Promasidor_Kenya_Limited_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_E001 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2948 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
c80b259dd67b-2,"The claimant states that Inyani enterprises, allegedly owned by him is non-existent, and the same can be proved by conducting searches with the companies’ registry. 
On the part of the respondents it is stated that the respondent received anonymous information about possible fraud in its operations, which allegedly involved the respondent’s staff.  Over a period of time the respondent reviewed its operations with the aim of identifying the possible problem areas and the extent, if any, of the fraud. The respondent engaged Stealth Africa Consulting Limited to assist with investigating areas where suspicious activities were noted. 
In March 2021 the respondent directed its review towards members of staff who regularly dealt with or had contacts with suppliers. During this review, the respondent states that it received anonymous information regarding the activities of various staff members. In respect of the claimant it was alleged that he had been involved in or aided and abetted activities that breached the respondent’s requirement that staff act with integrity and promote a culture of ethics and compliance, and that he was involved in activities that constituted conflict of interest. 
The respondent states that in view of the general nature of the information that the respondent had received anonymously, the respondent considered that it was necessary to commission an investigation to ascertain the full facts and circumstances relating to the alleged breaches. 
Consequently, the respondent suspended the claimant from employment vide a letter dated 15.03.2021 in order to facilitate the carrying out of an investigation. The claimant was informed of the suspension as well as the reasons and terms thereof. 
Stealth Africa Consulting Limited conducted the investigations by interviewing staff members, conducting analysis of forensic images from the laptop that the respondent assigned the claimant for work purposes and the carrying out of company and business searches. 
On or about 23.03.2021 an investigation report was submitted by Stealth Africa Consulting to the respondent, as regards the aforesaid investigations. The respondent states that the investigation report identified various alleged breaches by the claimant together with evidence supporting the alleged breaches. 
The respondent considered the above and decided to give the claimant an opportunity to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him. 
That by a letter dated 24.03.2021 the respondent informed the claimant of the alleged breaches and requested him to show cause in writing on or before 27.03.2021 why disciplinary action should not be taken against him.",Inyani_v_Promasidor_Kenya_Limited_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_E001 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2948 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
c80b259dd67b-3,"The claimant did not request for additional time to prepare his response, but responded through his letter of 27.03.2021. Upon receiving the response the respondent reviewed it and found it unsatisfactory and instead decided to convene a disciplinary hearing. 
By a letter dated 30.03.2021 the respondent invited the claimant for a disciplinary hearing, in which it informed the claimant of his right to be accompanied to the disciplinary hearing by a fellow work colleague of his choice. 
The respondent states that the claimant did not request for additional time to prepare for the disciplinary hearing. 
By a letter dated 01.04.2021 the respondent terminated the claimant’s employment by summary dismissal. In the said letter, the respondent advised the claimant of his right to appeal against the decision to terminate him, however, the claimant did not exercise this right. 
The parties filed their respective submissions. The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
To answer the 1st issue, the Court returns that there is no dispute that parties were in a contract of service. The respondent employed the claimant as the Supply Chain Manager by the letter dated 21.12.2010 effective 01.03,2011. He was promoted to Supply Chain Director by the letter dated 09.12.2016. By letter dated 24.04.2019 his salary was increased to Kshs.426,368.25.
To answer the 2nd issue, there is no dispute that the contract of employment was terminated by the letter of summary dismissal dated 01.04.2021 on account of gross misconduct upon particulars enumerated in the letter. The termination was effective 01.04.2021. He was to be paid prorated salary up to and including 01.04.2021, the last day of service; leave accrued but not taken; and, gratuity.",Inyani_v_Promasidor_Kenya_Limited_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_E001 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2948 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
c80b259dd67b-4,"The 3rd issue is whether the termination was unfair. On procedure, the claimant was suspended by the letter dated 15.03.2021. While testifying that the suspension was imposed without prior warning and reasons disclosed, the letter refers to a meeting on 15.03.2021 between the claimant and the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mr. Olivier Thiry, the Managing Director (MD) Mr. Mark C. Williams; Doris Njoroge the Human Resource Manager (HRM). The letter states that at the meeting the claimant had been informed about information suggesting that he had breached the terms and conditions of service of the employment and provisions of the respondent’s Code of Business Conduct relating to claimant’s acting with integrity and promotion of a culture of ethics and compliance; the protection and use of the Company’s assets; and compliance with rules on conflict of interest. He was therefore suspended pending the investigations. The claimant says that the suspension was unfair for want of particulars of the allegations. The Court finds that concern unfounded because the suspension was clearly a preliminary decision pending investigation. It appears that investigations were to be carried out to crystallise the allegations. Further, the claimant had attended the meeting and was informed the circumstances prior to suspension. The Court finds that the suspension being a preliminary decision based on preliminary inquiry, the respondent had not adopted an unfair procedure in the manner the suspension had been imposed. The letter was categorical that the suspension was on full pay as the claimant remained an employee. The letter further stated that the suspension was not a disciplinary sanction but it was a necessary tool to facilitate the investigation referred to in the letter. It was categorical that the company would contact him and convey the findings once the investigations were completed. In all circumstances and as submitted for the respondent the suspension has not been shown to have been unlawful or unfair in the circumstances of the case.
Further on procedure, the claimant confirmed he received the request to show cause being the letter dated 24.03.2021. It was allegations were levelled against the claimant as follows:",Inyani_v_Promasidor_Kenya_Limited_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_E001 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2948 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
c80b259dd67b-5,"Breach of the respondent’s Code of Business Conduct and terms of employment by causing or abetting aiding and abetting the making of payments to supposed suppliers of the respondent for fictitious supplies hence loss of respondent’s funds. That included claimant’s approval of Local Purchase Orders (LPOs) for the supposed suppliers knowing well that supplies had not been delivered by the supposed suppliers. Such suppliers included Gibcoll Enterprises which was paid Kshs. 1,250,545.00 for fictitious supply of spare parts and consumables between January and November 2020; Koyitoror Merchants Limited which was paid a total of Kshs.257,720.00 for supply of spare parts and consumables between January and November 2020; and Toror Merchants and Lyne and Alia Engineering Ltd.
In breach of the Code he received Kshs.25,000.00 from Patel Mondish Kumar Dineshkumar on 04.03.2020 and who was the Manager at Bindip Ltd, a supplier of the Company.
None disclosure of multiple interests including  directorship or shareholding- by using company assets for personal benefit or for the benefit of other persons; using the respondent’s assets, computer and equipment for outside business or unethical activities; engaging in personal activities during working hours. The allegations included use of respondent’s intellectual property such as on 07.08.2020 he prepared a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) between himself and Royal Converters Limited to provide consultancy services in the development of an extrusion process for textured vegetable protein in circumstances that Royal Converters Limited was not a customer of the Company and had no business relationship with the company. The MOU had been prepared using respondent’s time and laptop. Under the allegation, other specific allegations whose specifics were stated were levelled against the claimant.",Inyani_v_Promasidor_Kenya_Limited_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_E001 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2948 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
c80b259dd67b-6,"The claimant replied the letter to show cause by his letter dated 26.03.2021. He denied making the LPOs; he denied knowing the mentioned suppliers subject of the LPOs allegations and finance director was answerable on how payments may have been effected; he had not received money from Patel Mondish in capacity as company supplier and allegations were intrusive of his privacy in illegal access of his mobile phone; the MOU remained a draft and there was no contractual relationship or as Inyani Enterprises Consultancy or Limited was a fictitious company; he had used company time and laptop or equipment because he desired that the same communication be in respondent’s best interest and acted with utmost good faith.
Further by letter dated 30.03.2021 he was invited to attend the disciplinary hearing which he attended on 31.03.2021. The dismissal letter was dated 01.04.2021.
The Court finds that the procedure adopted by the respondent was per the prescribed notice and hearing in section 41 of the Employment Act. While alleging that the time to defend himself was short, he as well confirmed that he never asked for the extension of the time to prepare.  He lamented that the investigation report was not provided but despite the request to show cause stating that the investigation report had made the specific findings per the levelled allegations, he ably made his response to each allegation by the letter dated 26.03.2021 without asking for the report or suggesting that he needed details about the findings beyond what was in the request to show cause. Thus, as submitted for the respondent, the procedure was not unfair at all.",Inyani_v_Promasidor_Kenya_Limited_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_E001 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2948 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
c80b259dd67b-7,"For the reasons for termination the Court returns that the respondent has established that they were valid as per section 43 of the Employment Act and as well, they were fair per section 45 of the Act as they related to the respondent’s operational requirements and, the claimant’s compatibility and conduct. The claimant did not deny but admitted using the respondent’s time and equipment to draw the MOU. The MOU, he admitted, had been drawn yet it amounted to a design to unfairly interfere with the respondent’s enterprise. The claimant admitted in his testimony that he had communicated as was alleged against him and urged that it was in the respondent’s best interest. How that could be was not demonstrated at all. As submitted for the respondent, there is nothing on record which, on a balance of probability, would exculpate the claimant. The Court finds that claimant 100% contributed to his summary dismissal when he breached the terms and code of service as was alleged. The respondent’s submissions are upheld in that regard.
Thus, the Court returns that the termination was not unfair both in procedure and substance.
The 4th issue is on remedies. The Court returns that the claimant has not established any of the remedies as being justified. One-month notice-pay and compensation were based on a return that the declarations as prayed for are awarded. The Court has found they are not justified at all. Offshore quarterly net payment was futuristic per the claimant’s own testimony and the Court finds they were unjustified. The suit must therefore collapse with costs.
In conclusion the suit is hereby dismissed with costs for the respondent, and, the Deputy registrar to cause the court file to be returned to the Machakos Court’s sub-registry forthwith.

********************
RULING
The Application dated 1st August, 2023 brought pursuant to Rule 4 Court of Appeal Rules, 2010 seeks;
Leave for extension of time to file a notice of appeal; and the intended appeal;
that the annexed memorandum of appeal be deemed as properly on record, and be admitted for hearing;
there be stay of execution of the ruling delivered on 30th November 2021, pending hearing and determination of the application and the intended appeal;
costs be in the cause.
The application is supported by the affidavit of even date sworn by Richard Mapesa Matuli who deposes that due to ill health, he was not in a position to instruct his counsel to file the appeal in a timely manner, although his advocate has now requested for the decree as well as the certified typed proceedings emanating from the court; and a draft notice of appeal has also been prepared.
The matter was listed for hearing on 1st November 2023, but the respondent had not filed any response to the application; and none of the parties filed any written submissions. The only rational conclusion to make is that the applicant has lost interest in the matter which is now deemed as unprosecuted. It is thus dismissed for want of prosecution under rule 58 (1) of the Court of Appeal Rules. I make no orders on costs.

- VERSUS -
ABSA BANK KENYA PLC……………...………RESPONDENT
 (Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
RULING
The applicant filed the application dated 03.10.2023 through J.A. Guserwa &Company Advocates. It was under Articles 41 and 47 of the Constitution and Rule 17 of the Employment & Labour Relations Court (Procedure) Rules 2016 and all other enabling provisions of law. The prayer is for grant to the applicant leave to file his petition out of time and the annexed petition be admitted by the Court for hearing and determination, and, costs of the application.
The application is based upon the annexed applicant’s supporting affidavit and is urged as follows:
The applicant was in the lawful employment of the respondent as the Branch Operations Officer since 2008.
By letter dated 23.03.2018 the respondent terminated the applicant’s position unlawfully and contrary to his right to fair labour practices. He applied for a review by his letter dated 29.03.2018 but the appeal against the summary dismissal was upheld by the respondent’s letter dated 10.05.2018.
The applicant was subjected to criminal proceedings that were determined on the 25.05.2023 long after the time for filing the instant suit had expired. It was a decision upon appeal before the High Court (Grace L. Nzioka J).
The applicant seeks to be compensated by the respondent, his former employer.
The respondent filed the replying affidavit of Mikah Gachanja, respondent’s Legal Counsel sworn on 18.10.2023 together with grounds of opposition both filed through Mboya Wangongu’u & Waiyaki Advocates. The grounds of opposition were as follows:
Section 90 of the Employment Act does not admit of any leave to file a petition out of time of limitation of 3-years for disputes relating to contracts of employment.",Munyua_v_ABSA_Bank_Kenya_PLC_(Miscellaneous_Cause_E157 of 2023)_[2023] KEELRC 2941 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
6de4abbe4720-1,"Part III of the Limitation of Actions Act Cap 22 does not apply as to permit leave as prayed for to file the petition.
The petitioner has not advanced a good reason for not filing the petition or claim prior to lapsing of the time of limitation.
The application is unduly delayed filed 130 days after the decision in the criminal appeal delivered on 25.05.2023.
The cause of action accrued more than 5-years ago. It is prejudicial to require the respondent to defend such action but for the applicant’s indolence.
The proposed suit has low chances of success because the summary dismissal was with due procedure and a fair reason. Further, the Court in the criminal appeal judgment found the applicant had not conducted due diligence and was negligent. No material is exhibited to support the proposed petition.
Submissions were filed for the parties. The Court has considred the material on record.
The only issue is whether the Court should exercise discretion in favour of the applicant to grant leave for filing of petition belatedly and the time of limitation under section 90 of the Employment Act, 2007 having lapsed. As urged for the respondent there is no disabling ground established why the applicant failed to file suit prior to lapsing of the time of limitation in section 90 of the Act. It is that a petition to enforce fundamental freedoms and rights can be entertained belatedly despite statutory time of limitation provided the petitioner establishes the disabling circumstances that may have made it impossible to move the Court within the prescribed time lines. Such factors have not been established and even if they existed, the procedure would be to simply file the petition as merited and any objections in that regard established and urged in the petition if objections on time of limitation are raised.  
The Court considers that where petitions are entertained despite periods of limitation, it is not that the Court is then granting leave but that in the circumstances the cause of action in the petition is found valid as urged and, in the circumstances, not being urged on the basis of leave granted. The Court finds that no provision of law has been urged granting the Court the jurisdiction or pwer to extend time or grant leave as prayed for.
It appears that, as submitted for the respondent, after the summary dismissal and rejection of the administrative appeal or review, the cause of action crystallised but the applicant offers no explanation why he failed to promptly move the Court.",Munyua_v_ABSA_Bank_Kenya_PLC_(Miscellaneous_Cause_E157 of 2023)_[2023] KEELRC 2941 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)

JOSEPH MULINGE KILO ……………………..........RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the judgment and decree of Hon. A. N. Makau (PM) in Milimani CMCC No. 1719 of 2019 delivered on 24/2/2020)
JUDGMENT
The respondent in this appeal, JOSEPH MULINGE KILO filed Milimani CMCC no. 1719 of 2019 seeking general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities and special damages of ksh.3,550/= together with costs and interest for injuries the respondent sustained on 22/4/2018 while the respondent was riding motor cycle registration no. KMET 654V when it was hit by the 1st appellants motor vehicle registration no. KCF 750U.
The respondent who suffered cut wound web of the 2nd and 3rd fingers on the left hand, bruises on the left thumb, cut wound on the left leg, swollen tender left leg and blunt injury on the hip region blamed the 2nd appellants motor vehicle for the accident.
The trial court found that both the rider and the motor vehicle were to blame of the accident and apportioned liability at 80:20% in favour of the respondent against the appellants.
The trial court assessed quantum of damages as follows;
General damages for pain & suffering ■ksh.300,000
Special damages ■■■■ksh.    3,550
Total■■■■■■■ksh.303,550
Less 20% contributory negligence■ksh.242,840
The appellants have appealed against the said judgment and decree for the following reasons.
That the learned magistrate erred in law in failing to consider the provisions of the Traffic Act Cap 403 and the traffic rules thereunder as a result, arrived at an erroneous conclusion",Glaxo_Smithkline_Pharmaceutical_Kenya_Limited_&_another_v_Kilo_(Civil_Appeal_E278 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25400 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a7daf1a1d32a-1,"That the learned magistrate erred in fact by failing to scrutinize/evaluate the evidence tendered in this matter and as a result held the appellants wholly liable for the accident
The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to scrutinize the evidence tendered in support of the injuries suffered by the respondent and to correctly relate them to case law cited and as a result failed to arrive at a fair and reasonable compensation for the said injuries.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to find that the nature of the injuries by the respondent did not warrant an award of general damages of Kshs. 300,000
That the learned magistrate erred in law by failing to properly consider the appellants’ defence, evidence and submissions and in doing so arrived at an erroneous conclusion.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact by awarding an inordinately high award of damages for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.
The appellant submitted that the respondent does not give a comprehensive account of the accident but merely avers that he was lawfully riding motor cycle registration number KMEB 131Y along Ngong road-Green house when the driver of motor vehicle KCF 750U carelessly drove at high speed that it lost control and hit his motorcycle causing him very serious injuries.
The Appellants’ account of the accident, which was uncontroverted during trial was that on the fateful day at around 1:00 pm, the 2nd Appellant was driving motor vehicle registration number KCF 750U along Ngong Road intending to turn right into Ngong Lane. The visibility was clear and there was minimal road traffic.
 The 2nd Appellant indicated that he was turning right and once ascertaining the road was clear, turned right towards Double Tree Hotel and he had already turned when motor vehicle registration KMEB 131Y coming from the direction of Prestige Mall, hit its rear bumper.  That from the foregoing, it is clear that the accident occurred when the motor cycle registration number KMET 131Y hit the rear of motor vehicle registration number KCF 750U.",Glaxo_Smithkline_Pharmaceutical_Kenya_Limited_&_another_v_Kilo_(Civil_Appeal_E278 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25400 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a7daf1a1d32a-2,"The appellant argued that the respondent did not adduce any eye witness evidence to support his version of events from which he seeks the court to hold that the 2nd appellant is liable for the accident. he did not adduce any evidence proving that the 2nd appellant was driving the motor vehicle at an excessive speed and further the police abstract dates 11/7/2018 confirms the occurrence of an accident but does not state who the police blame for the accident.
It was therefore the appellants argument that the respondent failed to discharge his burden of proof to the required standard pursuant to section 108 and 109 of the evidence Act and the trial court erred in holding the appellants liable for the accident either wholly of partially.
On damages the appellant submitted that from the medical report dated 15/10/2019 the respondent suffered bruises in the left hand, cut wound on the left shin and blunt injury right hip region. It was the appellants argument that kshs. 300,000 was excessive and that an award of Kshs. 150,000 would be sufficient based on comparable cases. In support the appellants cited Ahmed Said Amadi v Jacob Fundi Mugo [2021] eKLR: where, the respondent herein was medically examined on 11th July, 2012. He sustained a cut to the head, lacerations on both the upper and lower lip, and an abrasion on the right elbow. PW2 indicated that the respondent would recover fully with no disability. The High Court awarded general damages of Kshs. 150,000.00
The respondent submitted that the trial court was justified in its findings on liability considering the evidence that was adduced by both parties. the trial court found that the 2nd appellant joined the road when it was not clear for her and determined that the appellants were 80% liable.
On damages the respondent argued that Kshs 300,000 as damages was sufficient and in support cited a decision of the High Court in the case of Robinson Njoroge v Daniel Obasa [2021] eKLR where the court upheld Kshs. 300,000 for comparable injuries.",Glaxo_Smithkline_Pharmaceutical_Kenya_Limited_&_another_v_Kilo_(Civil_Appeal_E278 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25400 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a7daf1a1d32a-3,"This being a first appeal, the duty of the first appellate court is to re-evaluate the evidence adduced before the trial court and to arrive at its own conclusion whether to support the findings of the trial court while bearing in mind that the trial court had the opportunity of seeing the witnesses. In Selle –Vs- Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 it was held in the following terms: -
“An appeal from the High Court is by way of re-trial and the Court of Appeal is not bound to follow the trial judge’s finding of fact if it appears either that he failed to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities, or if the impression of the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence generally.
An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled.  Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect.
In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate the evidence or if the impression based on the demeanor of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.” 
The issues for determination are as follows;
Whether the trial court was right on its findings on liability.
Whether the award of damages was inordinately high.
Whether the trial court failed to considered the defence and arrived at an erroneous decision.
On the issue as to whether the trial court was right in its findings on liability, the record is clear that the motor cycle hit the car from the back.
The trial court found that the 2nd appellant confirmed that the rider hit the motor vehicle at the rear.
The trial court said that the 2nd appellant knew that the rider had a right of way and she ought to have given way before joining the road.
The trial court also found that the rider ought to have slowed down to avoid hitting the motor vehicle at the rear.",Glaxo_Smithkline_Pharmaceutical_Kenya_Limited_&_another_v_Kilo_(Civil_Appeal_E278 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25400 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a7daf1a1d32a-4,"In the circumstances, I find that the court was not right on its findings on liability. I have re-evaluated the evidence and find that both were to blame for the accident and the court ought to have apportioned liability at 50:50%.
I accordingly set aside 80:20% ratio and substitute it with 50:50% liability for reasons that although the 1st appellant was hit at the rear, there is evidence she had already joined the road when she was hit at the back.
On the issue as to whether the award was inordinately high, I have considered the authorities relied on by the trial court and I find they were comparable.
The respondent sustained soft tissue injuries.
In Catherine Wanjiru Kingori & 3 Others v Gibson Theuri Gichubi [2005] eKLR the plaintiff therein suffered injuries on the left ankle, injuries on the legs and chest, dislocation of the left wrist, fracture of the radius and ulna and soft tissue injuries to the face. The Court awarded general damages of Kshs. 300,000 in 2005.
In Francis Ndungu Wambui & 2 others v Benson Maina Gatia [2019] eKLR quite recently, the High Court reviewed downwards an award of general damages of Kshs. 400,000 to Kshs. 300,000 for injuries of head injury with loss of consciousness and soft tissue injuries.
I find kshs.300,000 reasonable in the circumstances of this case. 
 I also find that the defence by the Appellant was referred to in the judgment.
I accordingly adjust the amount payable as follows
Liability is adjusted to 50:50% in against the appellant in favour of the respondent 
General damages for pain &suffering 300,000
Special damages■■■■      3,550
Total■■■■■■■ 303,550
Less 50% liability■■■■151,775
The trial court’s judgment is set aside and substituted with judgment in favour of the respondent against the appellants in the sum of ksh.151,775 with costs and interest from the time of the judgment of the trial court until payment in full.

KENYA WOMEN AND CHILDREN WELLNESS CENTRE ………………………………………1ST RESPONDENT
DELORIS JORDAN……………………….2ND RESPONDENT
(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the statement of claim on 22.05.2019.  The claimant as pleaded, was employed by the 1st respondent in 2013 and initially on casual basis. The respondent issued the letter dated 01.03.2019. It conveyed that the respondent had lost confidence and trust in the claimant and his last working day would be on 01.03.2019. he was directed not to report to work in the month of March but he would receive his pay check at the end of March 2019. His certificate of service was attached on that letter of termination of employment. The certificate stated that he had worked for the 1st respondent from January 2013 as a consultant up to September 2014. Further, he was a full time employee from August 2014 to 1st March 2019. The certificate and the letter were signed by the 2nd respondent as the President of the 1st respondent.
The claimant alleges that the termination was unlawful and unfair and claims and prays for:
5-years salary 112, 244 x 12 x 5 = Kshs.6, 734,640.00.
Gratuity for 5 years Kshs.112,244 x5 = Kshs.561,220.00.

4ba15e8261a3-1,"Costs of the suit.
Any other order the Court deems fit.
The respondent filed the statement of response on 06.02.2021 through Archer & Wilcock Advocates. The respondent admitted employing the claimant and as at termination the prevailing contract of service was the one dated 01.04.2018. and he served as a driver or Program Training Support Team Member in the 1st respondent’s establishment. The respondent further pleaded as follows. On 28.01.2019 the 1st respondent lost several assets through internal theft. A staff meeting was called and the claimant and other two staff members were summoned and heard in self-explanation. The 1st respondent considered the proceedings and lost trust and confidence in the claimant and the contract was terminated in accordance of with the terms and conditions of service. The claimant was paid one-month salary in lieu of notice and he unreservedly acknowledged receipt. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs as lacking in merits.
The claimant testified to support his case. The respondent’s witness (RW) was Pauline M. Gathanga, the 1st respondent’s Program Manager. Final submissions were filed for the parties.
There is no dispute that the parties were in a contract of service and the contract was terminated by the letter dated 01.03.2019. 
Was the termination unfair? By his own testimony the claimant confirmed that on 28.01.2019 some incident took place because the 1st respondent’s office was broken into and some items stolen. Further, he confirmed that thereafter a meeting was convened and everyone was investigated and he gave his version of the account. After the meeting he was given a notice of termination of the contract of employment dated 01.03.2019. he confirmed that earlier in his service on 29.01.2018 he was arrested surrounding some banking event but later he was released and continued working for the 1st respondent. RW testified that as at termination of the claimant the issue of theft was under investigation.",Molla_v_Kenya_Women_and_Children_Wellness_Centre_&_another_(Cause_328 of 2019)_[2023] KEELRC 2934 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
4ba15e8261a3-2,"The Court has considered the material evidence that a meeting was held following the theft and the 1st respondent concluded it had lost confidence in the claimant and terminated per termination clause. The Court considers that as urged for the respondents, the 1st respondent was entitled to invoke the contractual termination clause which is as well recognised in section 35 of the Employment Act. In the circumstances it cannot be said that the reason for termination was unfair or the procedure was unfair. The Court upholds the respondent’s case and submission in that regard and in view of sections 43 and 45 of the Act. It was submitted for the claimant that it was unfair for want of a genuine reason per section 43 and due procedure per section 41 of the Employment Act, 2007. The Court has found that the invoked contractual clause was available in the circumstances of the case and loss of trust and confidence appears to have been a genuine reason, the claimant and RW having confirmed the theft in issue and the investigative meeting indeed took place. The reason for termination was diminished trust and confidence and the procedure was invoking the contractual termination clause. It is not for the Court to get into the respondent’s mind to graduate impact of the incidence and trust or confidence levels. What is important is that the theft took place and in the circumstances, it is not far fetched that the trust and confidence dwindled or likely diminished. The Court will not interfere with the respondents’ discretion in that regard to terminate the contract of service.
The Court returns that as submitted for the respondents, the claimant has not shown statutory or contractual or other basis for claiming Kshs.6,734, 640.00 salary for 5 years. As for gratuity, as urged for the respondent, it is not due per section 35 of the Act because the claimant was a member of the National Social Security Fund. For the claim of leave, the claimant confirmed that he had taken all his leave days. The claimant would not be entitled to receive statutory deduction dues and any failures in that regard would fall for resolution under the relevant statutes.
In conclusion the suit is hereby dismissed with costs.

RULING
The application coming for consideration in this ruling is the one dated 6/12/2018 brought under Order 2 Rule 15, Order 6 and Order 51 rule 1 of the Civil Proceedings rules 2010 seeking the following prayers
The plaint dated 11th June 2018 and lodged by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs be struck out in respect of the allegations against the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant.
That costs of this application be borne by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs.
The application is based on the grounds on the face of it as follows;
The plaintiff filed the plaint dated 11th June, 2018 out of time and it is therefore time barred due to limitation of time.
That notwithstanding, the plaint is based on a grave misconception about the employment and engagement of the 1st defendant not a publisher.
The plaintiff’s plaint is sub judice as it seeks to use the forum of this honourable court to litigate and influence court matters that are pending adjudication in various other courts.
The plaintiffs’ plaint is based on allegations that are contrary to the freedoms of speech guaranteed under article 33 of the constitution of Kenya.
The plaintiffs have not specifically disclosed how the alleged publications have undermined their reputation and character in the eyes of the right thinking members of the society.
The plaintiff does not disclose a reasonable cause of action for a defamation suit, let alone a cause of action against the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant.",Tatu_City_Limited_&_another_v_Mwagiru_&_5_others_(Civil_Case_136 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25354 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
ecdafefeebcb-1,"The plaintiffs’ allegations of harassments and malice are mere allegations as they are devoid of concise and specific particulars with respect to the 1st defendant and 2nde defendant.
The plaintiffs allegations are unrelated and are farfetched and thus cannot be linked to the alleged cause of defamation that the plaintiffs very unimaginatively strive to pursue on the instance case.
The plaintiffs’ imputations of gross criminal behavior by the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant are based on plaintiffs’ opinions and actions which are contrary to the express provisions of criminal and land laws on finding of guilt and placement of caveats hence it is an abuse of the court process.
The plaintiff is significantly based on wild and unfounded allegations against the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant that are completely unrelated and remote to their insinuation of defamation.
The plaint as filed has no legs to stand on and should be cut off at the knees to/and avoid an expensive and wholly unnecessary waste of scarce judicial time and resources; an act that is inimical to public policy interest.
It is in the interest of justice that the plaint dated 11th June, 2018 be struck out with costs at the earliest opportunity as it discloses no reasonable cause of action against the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant and lacks merit.   
The plaintiff filed a replying affidavit sworn on 31/5/2019 by CHRISTOPHER BARRON opposing the application dated 6/12/2018 in which it is deposed that the application herein is an abuse of court process. the application is too general in its nature and failed to particularize the ground the 1st and 2nd defendants are seeking to rely on to have this suit struck out.
He stated that in his affidavit the 1st defendant make it appear that he is the founder of Tatu City Project yet the same is blatantly false. The 1st defendant is only concerned about his own personal interests and not those of the companies and their project. The 1st defendant and his proxies have taken all steps necessary to try and bring the projects to a stand still to the detriment of the plaintiffs and its stakeholders.",Tatu_City_Limited_&_another_v_Mwagiru_&_5_others_(Civil_Case_136 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25354 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
ecdafefeebcb-2,"He averred that the articles that were complained about were facilitating and procured at the behest and instructions of the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant procured the 4th defendant to cover the story allegedly that the 1st and 2nd plaintiff were embroiled in a row with villagers over Tatu City Properties. This position is false. This was intended to destroy the image and reputation of the plaintiffs and their associate companies. The same was done with ill intent to insert pressure upon the plaintiffs and force them to undergo economic harm and damages.
The 1st defendant also procured the 5th and 6th defendants to publish a story in the business daily edition dated 23/5/2018 under the caption “Land Officials entangled in Tatu City fraud claims” concerning the 1st defendants claim in another constitutional petition namely Thika ELC Petition No. 5 of 2018 which was later withdrawn by the 1st defendant herein.
He stated that the stories complained of have been published by the 4th , 5th and 6th defendant at the 1st defendant’s instance in the expectation that such an adverse publicity will prevent the development of the Tatu City Project otherwise paralyze the 1st and 2nd plaintiff’s operations thus creating a leverage for the 1st defendant to try and force a buy-out of his one share on his terms.
The parties filed written submissions as follows: the 1st defendants submitted that to sustain a suit for defamation, the Plaintiff must prove that there were either words or publication and that they were defamatory in that they lowered the reputation of the claimant. The 1st defendant submitted that the plaint does not mention the words that were defamatory which were spoken by the 1st defendant. The Plaintiff only alleges that the 1st Defendant procured the 4th, 5th, and 6th Defendants to publish defamatory words. That is not an element of uttering a word as is contemplated by the court in of Joseph Njogu Kamunge v Charles Muriuki Gachari [2016] eKLR■",Tatu_City_Limited_&_another_v_Mwagiru_&_5_others_(Civil_Case_136 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25354 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
ecdafefeebcb-3,"The 1st defendant submitted the Plaint has not specifically disclosed how the alleged publications have undermined the reputation of the Plaintiffs in the eyes of the right-thinking members of the society. Having fallen short of this element, the Plaint does not sustain a defamation suit let alone against the 1st Defendant.
The 1st defendant submitted further that the matter is barred by limitation of time. The cause of action of the Plaintiffs against the 1st Defendant has no chance of success because the suit was instituted on 11/6/2018. It is based on the alleged invalidity of caveats which were removed by the Registrar on Chief Land Registrar on the 25/5/2012 and the Nairobi Civil Application No. 198 of 2013 which was filed in 2013.
The 1st defendant argued that he is a mere citizen of Kenya and has no control or influence over the journalists that work for the Business Daily or the Nation Newspapers. The 1st Defendant is not a publisher or a proprietor of any newspaper making media house as alleged by the Plaintiffs at paragraph 11 of the Plaint. Neither is the 1st Defendant an employee of any publishing company within or without Kenya. No particulars of any statement uttered by the 1st Defendant have been alleged in the Plaint.
The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs submitted that law is very clear and categorical on the nature of an Application seeking to strike out a suit and the threshold that must be met. Under Order 2, Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, provides:
""(1) At any stage of the proceedings the court may order to be struck out or amended any pleading on the ground that-
a. it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence in law; or■ 
b. it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or
c. it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or
d. it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court,
and may order the suit to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.
(2) No evidence shall be admissible on an application under sub rule (1) (a) but the application shall state concisely the grounds on which it is made.""",Tatu_City_Limited_&_another_v_Mwagiru_&_5_others_(Civil_Case_136 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25354 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
ecdafefeebcb-4,"The plaintiffs submitted the application herein disregards Order 2, Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules, the 1st Defendant's submissions contain material evidence which should not form the substance of an application for striking out. The Application filed by the 1st Defendant are mere side shows aimed at distracting the Court from the real issues before it for determination.
It is trite law that summary procedure is a radical remedy and a court of law should be slow in resorting to this procedure which can only be applicable in plain, clear and obvious cases. Madan J (as he then was) in D T Dobie & Company (Kenya) Limited v Muchina,[1982]KLR 1,at page 9,said:
“The Court ought to act very cautiously and carefully and consider all facts of the case without embarking upon a trial thereof before dismissing a case for not disclosing a reasonable cause of action or being otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court. At this stage the Court ought not to deal with any merits of the case for that is a function solely reserved for the judge at the trial as the Court itself is not usually fully informed so as to deal with the merits without discovery, without oral discovery tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way.”
A pleading ought to be struck out if it is shown to be completely bad to the extent that not even an amendment can save it. The Court of Appeal in Francis Kamande v Vanguard Electrical Services Limited, Civil Appeal Number 152 of 1996, [1998] eKLR, observed that the summary procedure can only be adopted when it can be clearly seen that a claim or answer is on the face of it “obviously unsustainable.”
The plaintiffs further submitted that the Plaint filed on the 11/6/2018 is not barred by the Statute of Limitations Act as it is not a defamatory suit as alleged to be by the 1st Defendant a clear indication, he has not properly understood the suit filed herein or feigns ignorance by alleging that this is a defamatory suit. The 1st Defendant is well aware that the issues raised in Plaint relate to the conduct of the 1st Defendant that has caused great financial loss to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff which he cannot use this court to escape from the same.
The issues for determination in this application are as follows;",Tatu_City_Limited_&_another_v_Mwagiru_&_5_others_(Civil_Case_136 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25354 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
ecdafefeebcb-5,"The issues for determination in this application are as follows;
Whether this suit discloses a cause of action against the 1st and 2nd defendants.
Whether the plaintiff’s suit is statute time barred.
Whether the plaintiff’s suit against the 1st and 2nd defendants should be struck out.
On the issue as to whether the suit discloses a cause of action against the 1st and 2nd defendants, I find that this is not an issue that can be determined at interlocutory stage.
There is need for a full hearing for the court to determine the said issue.
On the issue as to whether the plaintiff’s suit is statute time barred again the issue needs ventilation by adducing evidence to determine when the cause of action arose.
On the issue as to whether the plaintiff’s suit against the 1st and 2nd defendants should be struck out, I find that striking out of the suit would be a draconian step.
The duty of the court is to preserve pleadings no matter how hopeless. In Yaya Towers Limited v Trade Bank Limited (In Liquidation) (Civil Appeal No. 35 of 2000) the same court expressed itself thus:
“A plaintiff (defendant) is entitled to pursue a claim in our courts however implausible and however improbable his chances of success. Unless the defendant (plaintiff) can demonstrate shortly and conclusively that the plaintiff’s claim is bound to fail or is otherwise objectionable as an abuse of the process of the Court, it must be allowed to proceed to trial...It cannot be doubted that the Court has inherent jurisdiction to dismiss that, which is an abuse of the process of the Court. It is a jurisdiction, which ought to be sparingly exercised and only in exceptional cases, and its exercise would not be justified merely because the story told in the pleadings was highly improbable, and one, which was difficult to believe, could be proved.”
The application dated 6/12/2018 lacks in merit and the same is dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs.

ELRC CAUSE NO. 1106 OF 2018
PITALIS MUSITIKHO ANDUKA■CLAIMANT 
- VERSUS -
ROSOLO BUILDING CO. LIMITED ■………….RESPONDENT
(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the Statement of claim on 02.07.2018 through Wanyonyi & Muhia Advocates. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
The sum of Kshs.2,769,237.44.
Cost of this suit.
Interests on (a) and (b) above at Court rates. 
Any other relief that this Honourable Court may deem just. 
The Statement of response was filed on 23.08.2018 through Oyatta & Associates Advocates. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant’s case was that he was employed by the respondent on or about January 2000, as a carpenter, and that he served the respondent with loyalty and diligence until 06.05.2017, when, without any lawful cause, the respondent terminated his services. 
The claimant states that the respondent breached the terms of employment by failing to confirm him as an employee having served it for 17 years as a casual labourer.
It is the claimant’s case that the respondent failed to pay him just wages in accordance with the minimum wages’ regulations by paying him Kshs.700/= per day instead of the stipulated wages of Kshs.1,062.65 per day. 
The claimant pleaded that the respondent unlawfully denied him annual leave and forced him to work seven days a week without overtime allowances.  
That he was on 03.05.2016 injured in the course of his employment and was subsequently compensated by the insurance company for the injuries at the sum of Kshs.859,200/= which was paid through the respondent. The claimant states that the respondent unlawfully withheld the compensation from him and his attempts to recover the said sum from the respondent led to his services being unlawfully terminated.",Anduka_v_Rosolo_Building_Co._Limited_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_1106 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2944 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
e4e7cccabf2e-1,"On the part of the respondents it is stated that the claimant was never its employee, but was instead a causal labourer who would be occasionally called upon to work for it whenever need arose. 
The respondent asserts that it was non-existent and had not been incorporated in the year 2000, and, that it only came into existence when it was registered in 2005. Therefore, the claimant could not have been its employee as claimed. 
The respondent states that it only required the services of the claimant in 2013 and in 2015, for a period of 3 weeks on both occasions, with the claimant being injured during the latter period while undertaking carpentry services for it. 
That during the said two periods, the claimant was fully remunerated upon completion of the carpentry tasks given. 
That on 04.06.2015 while the claimant was engaged by the respondent, he got injured and incurred medical expenses amounting to Kshs.62,319/= which expenses were subsequently compensated by the respondent through its insurance company for a sum of Kshs.81,915/=. That the work injury benefits claim is an entirely different cause of action and cannot therefore be brought under this suit. 
The Claimant testified by adopting his witness statement and final submissions were filed for him. The respondent, despite service, failed to avail the witness and no final submissions were filed in that regard. The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
The claimant has pleaded and testified that he served as a casual employee over a period of 17 years. The Court finds that by his own pleading and testimony per paragraph 2 of the witness statement, he was a casual employee, on and off. 
He enumerated his claims as follows:
Unpaid salary difference from 01.08.2013 – 30.05.2017 being 44 months thus 362.65 salary difference x1338.30.
One-month salary in lieu of notice Kshs.31, 879.50.
Salary from 01.05.2017 to 06.05.2017 Kshs.5, 313.25.
Unpaid leave for 17 years Kshs.541,951.50.
A year’s salary compensation for unlawful termination Kshs.382, 554.00.",Anduka_v_Rosolo_Building_Co._Limited_(Employment_and_Labour_Relations_Cause_1106 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2944 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
e4e7cccabf2e-2,"A year’s salary compensation for unlawful termination Kshs.382, 554.00.
Gratuity for 16 years 5 months Kshs.210, 404.70.
Injury compensation paid by Monarch Insurance Kshs.859,200.00.
Unpaid NSSF for 17-years Kshs.400 x 198 months = Kshs.79, 200.00.
Unpaid NHIF for 17 years Kshs.173, 400.00.
Total claim Kshs.2, 769,237.44.
The Court has considered the material on record. The Court returns that the claimant has asserted that he was a casual employee. How then could the Court award him claims as prayed based on monthly rates of payment? The Court finds the reliefs as claimed for are speculative and not established at all. It cannot be that the underpayment was for all 17 years and that the same rate of payment applied and which is not shown to have been the case. 
As relates to compensation for injuries suffered, counsel for the claimant surrendered the same on 26.07.2023 per orders on record.
If the relationship was casual, then how would the Court return that it was an unfair termination whereas the witness statement states that the termination was without notice on unspecified date. The date, in the statement of claim and in the witness’ statement was 03.05.2016 when the claimant suffered the injury. The date of the alleged termination is at large. The Court is unable to return a finding of unfair termination for want of due circumstances and particulars duly establishing the alleged unfair termination.
In conclusion judgment is hereby entered for dismissal of the suit with orders each party to bear own costs of the suit.
Signed, dated and delivered by video-link and in court at Nairobi this Friday 17th November, 2023.

RULING
The application coming for consideration is the one dated 17/4/2023 brought under Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure rules 2010, Section 1A, 1B, 3 and 3A of the Civil Procedure Act Cap 21 Laws of Kenya seeking the following orders;
THAT this application be certified as urgent and be heard urgently in the first instance.
THAT there be a stay of execution of the judgment and decree made herein on the 28th day March 2023 until the application herein is heard and determined.
THAT there be a temporary stay of execution of the judgment and decree made herein on the 28th day of March 2023 until the appeal preferred to the court of appeal is heard and determined.
THAT the judgment and decree be interpreted by this honourable court for determination of the rights of the defendants and the rest of the committee members of Muungano Slaughter House Women Society.
THAT the honourable court give directions on the status quo.
THAT costs of this application be in the cause.
The application is premised on the following grounds;
THAT judgment was read on 28th of March 2023.
THAT the defendant being dissatisfied with the said judgment have preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
THAT the defendants applied for a certified copy of the proceedings, judgment and decree on or about the 13th of April, 2023 for purposes of appeal.
THAT the 2nd plaintiff with other people who are not party to this suit have invaded the slaughterhouse and have started running the same.",Thiongo_&_2_others_v_Mbugua_&_2_others_(Civil_Case_119 of 2017)_[2023] KEHC 25356 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
08b00e2328da-1,"THAT such invasion is confrontational and is likely to cause mayhem and public disorder.
THAT unless properly interpreted such action might lead to bloodshed
The application is supported by the affidavit of MARY WAMBUI MBUGUA sworn on 17/4/2023 in which she deposed that being dissatisfied with the judgement and decree of the court the defendants have preferred an appeal to the court of appeal. She has applied and paid a deposit for certified copies of the proceedings judgement and decree in this matter.
On or about 6/4/2023 the 2nd plaintiff in the company of Veronia Munee, Mumina Bubicha, Joan Wangui Peter, Mary Muthoni and Amina Abdulla invaded the slaughter house belonging to Muungano Women Society and started running the affairs of the society without the decree of the court. Nothing in the judgement indicated that the 2nd defendant was to take over the running of the society without an election.
The respondents filed a replying affidavit sworn by WEDDY NJERI GITAU on 19/6/2023 opposing the application dated 17/4/2023. It is deposed that upon delivery of judgement this court became functus officio. That further the persons named in the affidavit by Mary Wambui were not in the initial suit and bear no correlation with the suit at hand. It is therefore imperative that should the defendant wish to enjoin them in the suit for the purposes of them responding, then she should file a fresh suit.
THAT the learned judge issued a declaration that reads ""That a Declaration is hereby issued that the Defendants have run down the affairs of the Society in Contravention with the Societies Constitution.” Read together with Order vi issued in the Decree, the Defendant was supposed to convene an all-inclusive special General Meeting under the supervision of the Registrar of Societies. She failed to convene the same opting to rush back to court seeking stay orders. The Judge in his wisdom noted that indeed the affairs of the society were not in good hands. It was imperative to form a committee to oversee the affairs of the Society post-judgment since the Defendant was non-committal on the same.",Thiongo_&_2_others_v_Mbugua_&_2_others_(Civil_Case_119 of 2017)_[2023] KEHC 25356 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
08b00e2328da-2,"Having failed to convene a General Meeting as ordered by the court, the prerogative was bestowed on her to convene the General Meeting in accordance with the law. The Registrar of Societies, having been satisfied that the issuance of notices and documents was proper, issued a letter dated 16/5/2023 wherein she approved our request to have the Special General Meeting and equally assigned officers from her office to assist in overseeing the process pursuant to the Court Orders.
The parties filed written submissions in the application as follows; the defendant/applicant submitted that they have complied with Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules and filed a Notice of Appeal on 12/4/2023 and served the same on the plaintiff’s advocates.
The defendants argued that the 2nd Plaintiff together with others invaded the slaughter house without a court order and took over the running of the society without first being elected in the general meeting as ordered by the court. There is no order in the judgement that give the 2nd plaintiff to take over the running of the society or to reinstate her to the position she had as secretary of the society. The court could have declared itself as clearly as it has on the other points.
The plaintiff/respondent submitted that the defendant/ applicant herein has not stated what substantial loss they are likely to suffer if their application is not granted. That in weighing whether to grant stay of execution pending appeal, the court must balance the rights of the Appellant as well as those of the respondent. The Applicant herein has mismanaged the affairs of the Society to the brink of collapse while almost selling off the society’s property. This has already been determined by the court.  Having failed to satisfy the principles for grant of stay of execution orders, the application should be dismissed.
The issues for determination in this application are as follows;
Whether the applicants are entitled to stay of execution pending appeal.
Whether the judgment delivered on 28/3/2023 should be interpreted for the determination of the rights of the defendants and the rest of the members of Muungano Slaughter House Women Society.
On the issue as to whether stay of execution should be granted pending the hearing and determination of the appeal, the governing principles for stay pending appeal is Order 42 Rule 6 which states as follows;",Thiongo_&_2_others_v_Mbugua_&_2_others_(Civil_Case_119 of 2017)_[2023] KEHC 25356 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
08b00e2328da-3,"“(1) No appeal or second appeal shall operate as a stay of execution or proceedings under a decree or order appealed from except appeal case of in so far as the court appealed from may order but, the court appealed from may for sufficient cause order stay of execution of such decree or order, and whether the application for such stay shall have been granted or refused by the court appealed from, the court to which such appeal is preferred shall be at liberty, on application being made, to consider such application and to make such order thereon as may to it seem just, and any person aggrieved by an order of stay made by the court from whose decision the appeal is preferred may apply to the appellate court to have such order set aside.
(2) No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—
(a) the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the Applicants unless the order is made, and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
(b) such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the Applicants”.
I find that the court gave declaratory orders which cannot be stayed. The court in its judgment dated 28th March 2023 gave the following declaratory orders:
“i.■A declaration be and is hereby issued that the defendants have run the affairs of the society in contravention of the society’s constitution.
ii.■A declaration be and is hereby issued that the special delegates meeting of the society held on 5th September 2012 was unlawful as it was held in contravention of the society’s constitution.
iii.■A declaration be and is hereby issued that all and/or any resolutions of the special delegates meeting of the society held on 5th September 2012, including the resolution to sell the society’s plot, are null and void.
iv.■An injunction be and is hereby issued restraining the defendants jointly and/or severally by themselves, their servants, employees, agents and/or through trustees of the society or otherwise howsoever, from selling, transferring, alienating, disposing or in any other way whatsoever parting with ownership and possession of all that parcel of land known as Title No.220/3 PT (UNS.Plot No. ‘B’).",Thiongo_&_2_others_v_Mbugua_&_2_others_(Civil_Case_119 of 2017)_[2023] KEHC 25356 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
08b00e2328da-4,"v.■An order be and is hereby issued requiring the defendants to give a true and just account of the society’s income.
vi.■An order be and is hereby issued compelling the defendants to convene an all-inclusive special general meeting of the society as directed by the Deputy Registrar of Societies vide his letter dated 10th May 2012 under the supervision and coordination of the Registrar of Societies.
vii.■The defendants shall pay the 2nd plaintiff’s costs of the suit.■
viii.■The 1st plaintiff’s suit abated while the 3rd plaintiff’s suit is hereby dismissed with costs.
It is so ordered.”
On the issue as to whether the judgment and decree of this court should be interpreted, I find that the judgment is very clear that the Defendants were required to convene an all-inclusive special general meeting of the society as directed by the Deputy Registrar of Societies vide his letter dated 10th May 2012 under the supervision and coordination of the Registrar of Societies. 
I find that the parties are duty bound to comply with the orders of the court.
 Since the declaratory orders cannot be stayed, the plaintiffs are directed to enjoin the Registrar of Societies for purposes of enforcement of the judgment of this court dated 28th March 2023.      
However, in view of the objection raised by the Defendant/Applicants that this his case is pending appeal, I direct that the parties proceed to the Court of appeal.
 This court is therefore functus official and I find that the Application dated 17/4/2023 lacks in merit and the same is dismissed with costs to the Respondents.

The defendants filed a notice of motion, dated 5th May 2021 seeking to set aside the ex parte Judgment entered on 25/7/2019 and leave to defend.
The application is premised on grounds that although the defendants entered appearance and filed a defence, they did not attend court for the hearing on 18th June 2019 because they were not aware of the hearing date.
According to the defendants, their advocates then on record (M/s Kyalo Mwengi & Co. Advocate) did not notify them of the hearing date and as a result they did not attend court. The defendants stated that as at 23rd October 2014 their advocates’ offices were still based at View Park Towers, Utalii Street and only relocated to Hughes Building on Muindi Mbingu Street in November 2018.
 The defendants asserted that due to their advocates’ mistake, judgment was entered against them and they faced the risk of execution as the respondents had instructed auctioneers to execute the decree issued against them for Euros 651,943.56.
The defendants argued that the judgment obtained against them was irregular and should be set aside. They also argued that notice of entry of judgment was not served on them to afford them an opportunity to appeal or apply for review of that judgment.
The defendant further stated that the application had been brought without undue delay and that the plaintiff would not suffer prejudice if the application was allowed. They however stood to suffer great prejudice if the judgment was not set aside and execution was allowed to proceed.",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a1e85621f047-1,"The defendants called for aid, article 159(2) (a) and (d) of the Constitution and sections 1A (1) and 1B (1) (a) of the Civil Procedure Act that regardless of the technicalities, it is just for the Court to allow their application so that they are not condemned unheard. 
The defendants faulted the plaintiff for failing to disclose to Court that they [defendants] had filed a suit (HCCC No. 824 of 2010) before the same court, between the same parties and over the same claims. 
The defendants took the view, that there was no basis for the plaintiff’s contention that there is conflict of interest since Mr. Robert Asembo did not represent the plaintiff in a bribery case or cyber-crime criminal case.
The defendants relied on Order 10 rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules that the court may set a side or vary judgment and any consequential orders on terms that are just. The defendants again relied on the Patel v E A Cargo Handling Services Ltd [1974] E A 75 that there are no limits or restrictions on the judge’s discretion to set aside or vary an exparte judgment.
The defendants again relied on Shah v Mbogo [1967] E A 166 that the discretion to set aside an exparte judgment is intended to be exercised so that to avoid injustice or hardship.
The defendants further cited the decision in Mungai v Gachuhi & another [2005] eKLR that a decision is final only when a proper hearing has taken place.
Response
The plaintiff opposed the application through a replying affidavit and written submissions. The plaintiff stated that despite efforts to have the suit heard expeditiously, the defendants’ advocates were unavailable for the fixing of hearing dates. When they failed to appear, his advocates served them with Hearing Notices and filed affidavits of service. He continuously followed up the case and travelled from Germany to attend the hearings but the case never took off. 
The plaintiff’s advocates raised concerns with the court that the suit was taking too long to conclude and the defendants’ advocates were again invited to fix a hearing date but did not attend. They were served with a hearing notice and an affidavit of service was filed.",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a1e85621f047-2,"On the hearing date, neither the defendants nor their advocates attended court. The case proceeded to hearing and on 25th July 2019 the court delivered judgment allowing the suit. 
The plaintiff contended that the defendants filed this application on 5th May 2021, more than one year and eight months after the judgment had been delivered an inordinate delay. The plaintiff also faulted the defendants for failing to inform the Court of the status of HCCC No. 824 of 2010 they said they had filed. 
The plaintiff argued that the firm of M/s Asembo & Co. Advocates having previously represented him, was improperly on record due to conflict of interest. Their Entering into the matter without leave or consent of the defendants’ previous advocates was also irregular and against Order 9 rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules.
The plaintiff asserted that the judgment is regular and he should be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the judgment. He relied on Order 12 rules 2(a) and 7 of the Rules that he was entitled to proceed with the hearing ex parte since the defendants had been served with a hearing notice. 
The plaintiff also relied on the decision in Josphat Nderitu Kariuki v Pine Breeze Hospital Ltd (Civil Suit 223 of 2005) [2006] eKLR that the defendants had not given sufficient explanation for their failure to attend court. Their advocates should thus bear the consequences of their professional negligence for failure to attend court on behalf of their clients.
The defendant again relied on Lucy Bosire v Nyankoni Manga (ELC 211 of 2009) [2016] eKLR, that it was the defendants’ responsibility to follow up their case. They cannot lay the blame on their previous advocates.
 Reliance was further placed on Josphat Muthui Muli (Industrial Cause No. 1224 of 2012) [2014] eKLR, that the court’s discretion to set aside an ex parte judgment is intended to be exercised to avoid injustice or hardship resulting from accident, inadvertence, or excusable mistake or error, but not to assist a person who has deliberately sought (whether by evasion or otherwise) to obstruct or delay the cause of justice.",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a1e85621f047-3,"The plaintiff cited brahim Mungara Mwangi v Francis Ndegwa Mwangi [2014] eKLR and Water Parnters International v Benjamin K’oyoo T/A Group of Women in Agriculture – Kochieng (Gwako) Ministries (Civil Case No. 105 of 2010) [2014] eKLR, that the application had been brought after an inordinate delay.
The plaintiff further cited Jackline Wakesho v Aroma Café (Cause No. 212 of 2013) [2014] eKLR that the defendants’ non-compliance with Order 9 rule 9 rendered the proceedings incompetent.
Determination
I have considered the application, the response and arguments by parties. I have also considered the decisions relied on in support of the parties’ respective positions.
The defendants’ reason for seeking to set aside the exparte judgment is that they were not aware of the hearing date. According to the defendants, their then advocates M/s Kyalo Mwengi & Co. Advocate did not inform them of the hearing date. That was the reason why they failed to attend court.
The defendants also argued that their advocates’ mistake caused the plaintiff to obtain judgment and decree against them for Euros 651,943.56 which was irregular and should be set aside so that they can have their day in court. The defendants again argued that notice of entry of judgment was not served on them as required by the rules.
Whether the judgment is irregular
The defendants’ argument is that the judgment entered against them is irregular and should be set aside ex debito justitiae: as a matter of right.
Whether a judgment is regular or irregular is a matter of fact to be determined from the circumstances of the case. The Court of Appeal has addressed the distinction between a regular and irregular judgment in several decisions.
In James Kanyita Nderitu V Maries Philotas Ghika & Another [2016] eKLR, the Court stated that:",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a1e85621f047-4,"In a regular default judgment, the defendant will have been duly served with summons to enter appearance, but for one reason or another, he had failed to enter appearances or to file defence, resulting in default judgment. Such a defendant is entitled, under Order 10 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules, to move the court to set aside the default judgment and to grant him leave to defend the suit. In such a scenario, the court has unfettered discretion in determining whether or not to set aside the default judgment, and will take into account such as the reason for the failure of the defendant to file his Memorandum of appearance or defence, as the case may be, the length of time that has elapsed since the default judgment was entered; whether the intended defence raises triable issues; the respective prejudice such party is likely to suffer.
The court then stated regarding an irregular judgment that:
[J]udgment will have been entered against a defendant who has not been served or properly served with summons to enter appearance. In such a situation, the default judgment is set aside ex debito justitiae, as a matter of right. The court does not even have to be moved by a party once it comes to its notice that the judgment is irregular, it can set aside the default judgment on its own motion. In addition, the court will not venture into considerations of whether the intended defence raises triable issue. Or whether there has been inordinate delay in applying to set aside the irregular judgment. The reason why such judgment is set aside as of right, and not as a matter of discretion, is because the party against whom it is entered has been condemned without notice of the allegations against him or an opportunity to be heard in response to those allegations. The right to be heard before an adverse decision is taken against a person is fundamental and permeates our entire justice system. 
In Bouchard International (Services) Ltd v M’mwereria [1987] KLR 193, the Court of Appeal held that:",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a1e85621f047-5,"The basis of approach in Kenya to the exercise of the discretion to be employed or rejected under either Rule 8 or Rule 10 (the latter dealing with judgement by default) is that if service of summons to enter appearance has not been effected, the lack of an initiating process will cause the steps taken to set aside ex debito justitiae. If service of notice of hearing or summons to enter appearance has been served, then the court will have before it a regular judgement which may yet be set aside or varied on just terms. To exercise this discretion is a statutory duty and the exercise must be judicial… 
The Court went on to state that:
A judge has to judge the matter in the light of all the facts and circumstances both prior and subsequent and of the respective merits of the parties before it would be just and reasonable to set aside or vary the judgement, if necessary, upon terms to be imposed. 
The decisions are clear that in a regular judgment, a defendant will have been properly served but for some reason, he failed to enter appearance of file a defence.  In such a case, the court still has wide discretion to set aside the judgment on terms that are just.
An irregular judgment will have been obtained without service or proper service on the defendant. Such a judgment will be set aside as a matter of right and the defendant granted unconditional leave to defend.
I have perused the record in this matter. The suit was filed on 14th July 2011 but did not take off until 18th June 2019. On that day, the plaintiff was present in court but the defendants and their advocate were not. The suit proceeded to hearing and judgment was delivered on 25th July 2019, which the defendants argue was irregular.
Order 12 rule 2 of the rules provides that if on the day fixed for hearing, after the suit has been called out for hearing outside the court, only the plaintiff attends, and if the court is satisfied that notice of hearing was duly served, it may proceed ex parte.
On 18th June 2019 when the suit came up for hearing, the court was informed that the defendants’ advocates had been served and upon satisfying itself of the service, the court proceeded to hear the suit.",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a1e85621f047-6,"The record shows that the defendants had been served with summons, entered appearance and filed a defence. Their advocate was also served with a hearing notice but both the defendants and their advocate failed to attend court for the hearing of the case. Failure to attend court, though served, did not make the judgment resulting from the exparte hearing irregular. It is therefore this court’s finding that the judgment entered against the defendants was a regular judgment.
Whether to set aside
The next issue is whether to set aside the exparte judgment. The court having determined that the judgment was regular, whether or not to set aside the judgment is an exercise of discretion which should be done on terms that are just. That is; this discretion like all other discretions, must be exercised judiciously.
40.In Shanzu Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Lands [1993] eKLR, the court delivered itself thus: 
The jurisdiction to vary judgment being a judicial discretion should be exercised judicially; and, as is often said, whether judicial discretion should be exercised or withheld in a party’s favour, depends, on a large measure, on the facts of each particular case. The tests for the exercise of this discretion are these: - First, was there a defense on the merits? Secondly, would there be any prejudice? Thirdly, what was the explanation for any delay.
In Shabir Din v Ram Parkash Anand (1955) 22 EACA 48 Briggs JA stated at page 51: 
I consider that under Order IX rule 20, the discretion of the court is perfectly free, and the only question is whether upon the facts of any particular case it should be exercised. In particular, mistake or misunderstanding of the appellant's legal advisers, even though negligent, may be accepted as a proper ground for granting relief, but whether it will be so accepted must depend on the facts of the particular case. It is neither possible nor desirable to indicate in detail the manner in which the discretion should be exercised.
In Yooshin Engineering Corporation v Aia Architects Limited (Civil Appeal E074 of 2022) [2023] KECA 872 (KLR) (7 July 2023) (Judgment), the Court of Appeal reiterated that:",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a1e85621f047-7,"[E]ven where the judgement is regular, the court still retains the wide discretion to set the same aside though if the Court decides to set aside the judgement, depending on the circumstances, it may do so on conditions that are just. That discretion, being wide, the main concern is for the court to do justice to the parties, and in so doing the court will not impose conditions on itself to fetter the wide discretion given to it by the rules. It has however to ask itself under what conditions, if any, it ought to set aside the judgement and such conditions, if appropriate, must be just to both the Plaintiff and the Defendant.
The decisions affirm that the discretion of the court to set aside a regular exparte judgment is wide but the discretion must be exercised judicious and any conditions to be imposed must be just to both parties, the plaintiff and the defendant.
I have gone through the record which shows that although judgment was entered on 25th July 2019, this application was only filed in May 2021, almost two years after the suit had been heard. The defendants, apart from stating that they were not informed of the hearing date, did not attempt to explain why they made no effort to find out from their advocates the status of their case. In other words, the defendants did not explain the delay in filing the application to set aside the judgment.
Even though the defendants again stated that their advocates then on record had not moved office when some letter was sent to them, that argument would not be relevant in this application. The issue here is why the defendants did not attend court and whether the exparte judgment should be set aside.
As already alluded to, this court’ discretion to set aside a regular exparte judgment though wide, must be exercised judiciously and for good reason. In this regard, it was the defendants’ duty to show that the circumstances they were relying on to seek to set aside the judgment were persuasive and that their failure to attend court was excusable.",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a1e85621f047-8,"I have perused the affidavit of service by Benson Mutinda sworn on 12th June 2019. The process server served a hearing notice on the defendant’s Advocates which was received and stamped. The defendants did not explain why they did not take steps to find out from their advocates the status of their case even if the advocates had not informed them of the hearing date. The defendants only woke up after the plaintiff moved to execute the judgment almost two years after the case had been heard, to persuade the court to exercise its discretion in their favour.
Regarding the defendants’ argument that notice of entry of judgment was not served, the defendants must have had in mind Order 22 rule 6 which states that where judgment in “default of appearance or defence” has been entered against a defendant, no execution by payment, attachment or eviction should issue unless not a notice of not than ten days notice of the entry of judgment has been served on him personally, and a copy of that notice is filed with the first application for execution.
It is plain from the rule that the notice is to be served where judgment is entered in default of appearance or defence. The rational for requiring service of a notice is to make the defendant aware of entry of judgment against him and the impending execution so that to obviate being taken by surprise. The defendant may take steps to challenge the default judgment in the event he disputes service of summons or even opt to pay to avert the impending execution.
Where appearance was however entered and a defence filed, like in this case, execution of the judgment entered after the exparte hearing of the case, (in the absence of the defendant), does not require service of the notice for entry of such judgment.
Flowing from my analysis above and after a careful consideration of the application, arguments by parties and on perusing the defence, the conclusion I come to is that the defendants have not satisfied this Court that they deserve this court’s discretion to set aside the regular exparte judgment entered against them.
I have perused the defence and, in my view, the defence is a mere denial that does not raise triable issues to call for leave to defend. The contention that there was another suit between the same parties over the same issue would not be a ground for setting aside a regular judgment since the defendants did not disclose to this Court what became of that suit.",Langer_v_Mutambu_&_another_(Civil_Case_303 of 2011)_[2023] KEHC 25372 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)

(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the memorandum of claim on 06.09.2018. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
Reinstatement of the grievant unconditionally 
Damages for loss of earning from the date of termination up to date. 
Costs of the suit in favour of the claimant 
In the alternative and where the reinstatement shall not be the best remedy, the claimant prays that the grievant to be paid the following as his terminal benefits to be based with the London distillers CBA which the grievant has 
The statement of response and counterclaim was filed on 07.11.2018 through Gichina Macharia Matotse Advocates. The respondent counter-claimed and prayed for:
The claim to be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant be condemned to pay damages in the tune of Kshs.1,000,000/= for breach of sound industrial relations. 
A declaration that the termination of William Nyakundi was fair and lawful. 
Any other relief the court deems fit. 
The claimant’s case was that its member, William Nyakundi Makori was employed by the respondent on 23.04.2012 as a general worker, at a starting salary of Kshs.7,586 per month. 
That his terms and conditions of employment were based on the CBA of London Distillers, the mother company of the respondent. 
On 29.09.2016 the employee was issued with a termination letter. However, following the intervention of the claimant, the employee was reinstated on 03.10.2016.","Kenya_Union_Of_Commercial,_Food_and_Allied_Workers_v_Kiambu_(Cause_1363 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2939 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)"
929df11d12ee-1,"The letter of reinstatement, indicated that the same would serve as a first warning. Subsequently on 05.11.2016, the employee was issued with another termination letter. However, the respondent had miscalculated his dues. 
The termination letter referred to an issue that was resolved in June 2016. Aggrieved, the employee reported the matter to the claimant, who took up the matter and referred the same to conciliation. 
It is the claimant’s case that the employee and itself, attended all conciliation meetings. The respondent failed to attend the same. 
The claimant’s case is that the termination of the employee’s employment was due to his membership with the claimant. 
It is stated that the respondent refused to issue the employee with a certificate of service and this has caused him difficulty in trying to secure another job. 
On the part of the respondent it is argued that the respondent is a privately-owned farm and residence of one, Mohan Galot his family and that the employee, William Nyakundi, was employed to work at the residence, located in Kiambu. 
The respondent’s case is that it does not have a recognition agreement or a CBA with the claimant. The duties of the employee have never been transferred to or reallocated to any entity, during the pendency of his employment. That the activities undertaken at the respondent estate fall outside the jurisdiction of the CBA, and that the respondent have never remitted union and COTU dues with regards to the employee. 
The respondent states that the employee has never been the claimant’s union member and that the claimant has no legal standing to bring the claim on behalf of the employee. 
The respondent pleaded that the employee was fairly and lawfully terminated and his terminal dues were computed in line with the employment law. 
The res
The parties filed their respective submissions. The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.","Kenya_Union_Of_Commercial,_Food_and_Allied_Workers_v_Kiambu_(Cause_1363 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2939 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)"
929df11d12ee-2,"The 1st issue is whether the grievant William Nyakundi Marori was a member of the claimant trade union. The claimant has pleaded that there is no recognition or collective agreements between the parties. The claimant has pleaded that by its registered constitution, it represents employees in real estate enterprises which the respondent is engaged in.  There is no pleading that the grievant is a member of the union. While there is no recognition, the recognition dispute is before conciliator but the employees of the respondent have been benefiting from the collective agreement in place. The letter of appointment is dated 19.04.2012. It does not refer or incorporate the collective agreement as alleged for the claimant trade union. As submitted for the respondent, the claimant has not shown that grievant for whose benefit the suit was filed was its member. The Court and the Court of appeal have settled that membership is to representation by union whereas collective bargaining is to recognition. Thus, a union cannot institute a suit for or represent a union if the employee said to be aggrieved has not been shown to be a member of the trade union. Even if recognition agreement had not been concluded between the parties, it was important to show that the grievant was a member of the union. The Court finds that the claimant failed to show that important precondition for justifying moving the Court the way it was done. The suit will fail for want of the grievant being a member of the claimant trade union. Confirming doubt about his membership in the union, the grievant testified thus, “I have filed a document to show I was a member of union. I paid union dues. I say no document on record to show I belonged to the union.”
The statement of claim shows that the claims and prayers were based on a collective agreement that has not been shown to bind the parties. The claimant not being a member of the trade union and there being no binding collective agreement, there is no way the terms in the collective agreement could become incorporated in the claimant’s contract of service. The claimant’s suit will fail.
It is pleaded and submitted for the respondent that it is not a person in law and in view of that position, the counterclaim would as well collapse without more to it. The point being that a no person in law cannot claim and obtain remedies in a Court of law. The Court finds accordingly. There will be no orders on costs.","Kenya_Union_Of_Commercial,_Food_and_Allied_Workers_v_Kiambu_(Cause_1363 of 2018)_[2023] KEELRC 2939 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)"

6061f67aa737-12,"Parties filed and exchanged written submissions. 
Mr Murunga, learned counsel for the 1st petitioner/protestor raised two issues for determination namely whether Samuel Wanjala Wekesa, Violet Nanjala Wekesa, Titus Nabukhamba and Patrick Wanyonyi are children of the deceased and/or dependents and whether the court should adopt the mode of distribution as proposed in the application. It was submitted that the said persons should not inherit the estate of the deceased as they are not biological children of the deceased. It was submitted that the said persons have their own biological fathers and that they have already been provided accordingly by their families. Learned counsel further submitted that there was no proof of dependency by the aforesaid persons who are for all intents and purposes strangers to the estate. To allow them to inherit the estate will cause great prejudice to the petitioners herein who should be left to inherit the estate of the deceased as proposed by the 1st petitioner.  Reliance was placed in section 29 of the Law of Succession Act and the case of Re Estate of Jedida Wambui Njoroge (deceased) Succession Cause 541 of 2014 [2022] KLR.
Mr Onyando for the 2nd and 3rd petitioners submitted that the proposed mode of distribution by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners should be accepted since all the beneficiaries except the 1st petitioner have duly signed the consent to distribution. It was submitted that the protestor failed to prove that the other beneficiaries were not dependent on the deceased prior to his death. Reliance was placed in section 3(2) and 29 of the Law of Succession Act. It was pointed out that the 1st petitioner in his evidence confirmed that the 2nd petitioner had come with her young children when she got married to the deceased and that the deceased took them in as his own children even as he sired the 1st petitioner and the 3rd petitioner. Learned counsel sought for the dismissal of the protest and that the grant be confirmed in accordance with the proposed mode of distribution by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners.

6061f67aa737-13,"Analysis and Determination 
I have given due consideration  to the rival evidence of the 1st petitioner/protestor and the 2nd, 3rd petitioners as well as the submissions of their respective learned counsels. It is not in dispute that the 2nd petitioner was married to the deceased after the deceased’s first wife died. It is also not in doubt that the said 2nd petitioner at the time of the marriage came along with her young childfren whom the deceased took in as his children. It is also not in dispute that the deceased and the 2nd petitioner were blessed with two biological children namely the 1st  and 3rd petitioners herein. It is also not in dispute that the 2nd petitioner had earlier been married to one Pinika  Kitui Namachanja and that upon his demise, she got married to the deceased herein. I find the two issues foe determination are firstly, whther the 2nd petitioner and her children born out of wedlock including the one introduced by the deceased namely Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa are dependants of the deceased and entitled to inherit his estate and secondly; which mode of distribution of the estate is suitable in the circumstances?
As regards the first issue, it is necessary to fall back on the Law of Succession Act as regards the question of who is a dependant. Section 29 of the Act provides:
‘’(a)         the wife or wives, or former wife, or wives, and the children of                               the deceased whether or not maintained by the deceased immediately prior to his death;
such of the deceased’s parents, step-parents, grandchildren, step-grandchildren, children whom the deceased had taken into his familyas his own, brothers and sisters, and half-brothers and half-sisters, as were being maintained by the deceased immediately prior to his death; and
( c) where the deceased was a woman, her husband if he was being maintained by her immediately prior to the date of her death.’’",In_re_Estate_of_Francis_Wekesa_(Deceased)_(Succession_Cause_3 of 2019)_[2023] KEHC 25420 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
6061f67aa737-14,"It transpired from the evidence that the 2nd petitioner at the time of her marriage to the deceased she came along with three children namely Samuel Wanjala, Titus Nabukhamba and Vilolet Nanjala who were then still young and that the deceased took them in as his own and maintained them. The deceased and the 2nd petitioner were subsequently blessed with two children namely Joseph Wamalwa Wekesa and Ann Kisaka Otieno. The evidence of the 3rd petitioner Ann Kisaka Otieno is that she is the first born biological child of the deceased and the 2nd petitioner and who stated that she grew up together with her brothers Titus Nabukhamba, Samuel Wanjala, Joseph Wamalwa as well as Violet Nanjala. She also testified that the deceased later introduced to the family Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa as one of his sons through Bahengele clan ceremony regarding children sired out of wedlock. She added that her father later organized for her brothers’ circumcision and that he later collected dowry during the marriage of Violet Nanjala. It was her evidence that the 1st petitioner has ganged up with the clan to disinherit her and the rest of the family. She vouched for the mode of distribution presented by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners. Her sentiments have been echoed by Oscar Wabwile Tela who is a brother to the deceased and who stated that the 2nd petitioner came along with her young three children when she married the deceased and that the deceased agreed to take them as his own and maintained them since he loved them. He also stated that in 2012 the deceased invited him for a ceremony wherein he introduced one of his sons sired out of wedlock namely Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa. It was his evidence that the 1st petitioner is ganging up with one John Kasembeli to disinherit the dependents of the deceased.  Geoffrey Musungu Walumbe a cousin to the deceased echoed the sentiments of Oscar Wabwile Tela that during the Bukusu ‘’Lufu’’ ceremony the clan members resolved that all the children of the 2nd petitioner who had been taken in by the deceased were deemed as the deceased’s children. He further stated that the deceased had taken parental responsibilities as he later circumcised the male childrenand lkater collected",In_re_Estate_of_Francis_Wekesa_(Deceased)_(Succession_Cause_3 of 2019)_[2023] KEHC 25420 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)

6061f67aa737-16,The 1st petitioner and his witnesses have strongly taken the view that the three children who came along with the 2nd petitioner during her marriage to the deceased are children of one Pinika Kitui Namachanja and that they have already been provided for in land parcel number East Bukusu/West Sangalo/487 and therefore should leave the 1st Petitioner and 3rd petitioner who are the biological children of the deceased to inherit land parcel East Bukusu/South Kanduyi/2612. The 1st petitioner has also maintained that Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa is a son to one Meshack Masinde Naracha and that he should pursue his interest there and should not claim from the deceased.,In_re_Estate_of_Francis_Wekesa_(Deceased)_(Succession_Cause_3 of 2019)_[2023] KEHC 25420 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
6061f67aa737-17,"It transpired that the 2nd petitioner’s former husband Pinika Kitui Namachanja owned parcel number East Bukusu/West Sangalo/487 and that the 1st petitioner now insists that the three children that accompanied the 2nd petitioner during her marriage to the deceased should proceed to occupy the land and leave him alone with his sister (3rd petitioner). It also transpired there was a dispute about the identity of the biological father of one of the beneficiaries namely Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa. Whereas the  maintains that 2nd and 3rd Petitioners claimed that the father of the said beneficiary was the deceased herein, the 1st petitioner maintains that Meshack Masinde Naracha is the biological father of Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners have claimed that the deceased had introduced the said Patrick Wnyonyi Wekesa as his son in 2012 and organized a ceremony over the same. A perusal of the pleadings herein reveals that one Meshack Masinde Naracha filed an affidavit sworn on 24/11/2021 wherein he vehemently denied being the biological father and added that even though he had a relationship with Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa’s mother following the death of her husband, he did not sire him and that he later learnt from his mother that the person who sired him was indeed the deceased herein and he thus severed the relationship.  At the time of the hearing of this matter both the deceased herein was already dead as well as the mother of Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa and hence the only person who could shed more light regarding his paternity is Meshack Masinde Naracha but who has denied being his biological father. Matters have not been helped any better since none of the parties herein availed any DNA evidence linking the said Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa to the deceased as his biological father or even to Meshack Masinde Naracha who has distanced himself.",In_re_Estate_of_Francis_Wekesa_(Deceased)_(Succession_Cause_3 of 2019)_[2023] KEHC 25420 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
6061f67aa737-18,"As the protestor has isolated the three children who acme alongside the 2nd petitioner during her marriage with the deceased, it was thus necessary for the said beneficiaries to prove the fact of dependency and show that the dceased had maintained them prior to his death. It is not in dispute that at the time of the marriage between the 2nd petitioner and the deceased, her three children sired by the late Pinika Kitui Namachanja were still minors and that thery grew up at the home of the deceased until the other children were (1st and 3rd petitioners) were born. If the said children remained with the deceased all that long, then it is obvious that the deceased had taken them in as his own children. The two clan elders, Oscar Wabwile Tela (PET. W6) and Geoffrey Musungu Walimbe (PET. W 8) confirmed that indeed the deceased had taken the three children born out of wedlock as his own and maintained them during his lifetime. They also stated that the said children were recognized as children of the deceased during the Bukusu ceremony (‘’lufu’’). Iam satisfied that the three beneficiaries namely Titus Nabukhamba Namachanja, Samuel Wanjala Wekesa and Violet Nanjala Wanyama have established on a balance of probabilities that they were mainatained by the deceased at the time of his death and are thus entitled to share in his estate. Even though the protestor and his witnesses have claimed that the said beneficiaries have already been provided for in the estate of Pinika Kitui Namachanja, I find such assertion does not prevent the said beneficiaries from having a shgare in the estyate of the deceased herein. The assets of the late Pinika Kitui Nmachanja are not part of the estate of the deceased herein and hence should not be used as a measure against what the beneficiaries are to get. The protestor’s grouse that his step- siblings are going to have more than him is thus not convincing since the two properties werer not wholly owned by the decased. The protestor therefore must be prepared to share the estate with his erstwhile step-siblings who apparently are children of two worlds so to speak. In any event, the issue of sharing need not necessarily be based on equality but equity.",In_re_Estate_of_Francis_Wekesa_(Deceased)_(Succession_Cause_3 of 2019)_[2023] KEHC 25420 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
6061f67aa737-19,"As regards Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa, it is noted that he was not staying with the deceased all his youthful life until 2012 when the deceased is reported to have introduced him to the family and held a small ceremony for him where he announced that he was his son born out of wedlock. It is instructive that the said Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa left as soon as the ceremony was over and thus did not stay with the deceased. No evidence was shown the that the deceased maintained him prior to his death. In fact it transpired that the said beneficiary used to work and reside within the catholic church around Kanduyi. Consequently, I find that he has failed to prove dependency to the required standard and hence he will be excluded from the distribution. Towards this end therefore, the protestor’s claim only succeeds to the extent that Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa stands excluded from the estate while the other three beneficiaries Titus Nabukhamba Nmachanja, Samuel Wanjala Wekesa and Violet Nanjala Wanyama  as well as the 2nd and 3rd petitioners will be entitled to a share in the estate.
As regards the second issue, it is notted that the 2nd anD 3RD petitioners have come up with a reasonable mode of distribution of the estate which caters for the three children born out of wedlock as wellas the two biological children of the deceased including the 2nd petitioner. It is noted that during the hearing of the protest, it came out clearly that the protestor exhibited a lot of distain against the 2nd petitioner who is his own biological mother and the only surviving parent. This was quite astonishing. It also transpired that the protestor had teamed up with a few clan members to remove thos who were not biological children of the deceased and further extended the ban on his own mother. At the time of the hearing, his mother was reported to be staying with one of her sons who is not a biological child of the deceased as it was claimed that her homestead had been demolished. Even though the protestor claimed that the 2nd petitioner’s house had been damaged by flash floods, the same is not convincing as it is obvious that the 2nd petitioner had been evicted from her house as he was not wanted in the area. The proposed mode of distribution by the protestor is",In_re_Estate_of_Francis_Wekesa_(Deceased)_(Succession_Cause_3 of 2019)_[2023] KEHC 25420 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
6061f67aa737-20,"not reasonable in the circumstances and is for rejection as there is element of discrimination. The proposed mode of distribution by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners appear to be reasonable save only that the share of Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa ought to be removed as he has not proved that he was a dependant of the deceased prior to his death. Hence, the share of that particular beneficiary will be distributed equally among the six beneficiaries.
In the result, the protestor’s protest partly succeeds to the extent that Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa is not a beneficiary and that his share of 2 acres will be distributed among the six beneficiaries equally so that each beneficiary will get an extra 0.3 acres. Consequently, the grant issued on 29/9/2020 is hereby confirmed and that the estate will be distributed as follows:
1.Florence Namarome Wekesa(Widow)…………0.8 acres
2. Ann Kisaka Otieno(daughter)………………….1.3 acres
3. Samuel Wanjala (son)…………………………..0.8 acres
4. Violet Nanjala (daughter)…………………….0.55 acres
5. Titus Namukhamba (Son)……………………0.8 acres
6. Joseph Wamalwa (son)……………………2.8 acres

- VERSUS -
KENYA PLANTATION AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS UNION■RESPONDENT
(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
RULING
The respondent has filed a notice of preliminary objection on a point of law application dated 24.03.2023 through Aduda & Company Advocates. The petitioner is in person.
The preliminary objection challenges the jurisdiction of the Honourable Court to hear and determine the matter, and was made upon the following grounds:
That the instant application has been filed in gross violation of the constitutional principle of avoidance.
That the instant petition does not raise any constitutional question(s) for the determination of this honourable court. 
That the instant petition is a gross abuse of due process as the exists sufficient statutory remedies to invoke 
That the instant petition is filed in gross abuse of due process as the same has purported to constutionalize an ordinary employer-employee dispute.  
That arising from above and as held by the supreme court of Kenya in the case of Communication Commission of Kenya & 5 others versus Royal Media Services Ltd Supreme Court of Kenya at Nairobi Petition no. 14 of 2014 this Honourable Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear and determine this petition and therefore the petition ought to be dismissed with costs. 
That arising from the above and as was held by the court of appeal in the case of Francis Gathugu Vs. Kenyatta University Civil Appeal no. 279 of 2013 any willy nilly attempt at constitutionalizing every common dispute must be discovered, named and rebuffed. 
That arising from the above and as was held in the case of the Owners of motor vessel ‘lilian S’ versus Caltex Oil (Kenya)(1989) [1KLR], a court without jurisdiction cannot proceed with the proceedings. 
Further to the above that jurisdiction is everything and without it a court cannot make one more step.",Khisa_v_Kenya_Plantation_and_Agricultural_Workers_Union_(Petition_E25 of 2023)_[2023] KEELRC 2943 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
37c55123ebc6-1,"And finally, further to the above, a question as to the jurisdiction of the court must be heard and determined in priority to any other proceedings. 
The consequent upon the above, the respondent will at the hearing of this preliminary objection of law urge the honourable court to dismiss this petition with costs. 
The petitioner swore a replying affidavit on 28.04.2023 in response to the respondent’s notice of preliminary objection, and stated thus:
That the Honourable Court was moved through the notice of motion application dated 08.07.2021 (consolidated with the present petition) under all enabling provisions of the law including all the inherent powers of the Employment and Labour Relations Court under sections 1A,1B, 3A and 63(c) of the Civil Procedure Act, 2010, Order 51 rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010 as read together with the Employment & Labour Relations Court (Procedure) Rules, 2016. 
That the petition raises triable issues to the Honourable Court over the manner and style which the respondent repudiated or breached the petitioner’s contract of employment, a matter that falls within the purview of the provisions of section 12 (1)(a) of the employment & labour relations court act, laws of Kenya. 
That the petition is a formal application which falls within the purview of the provisions of section 12 (2) of the Employment & Labour Relations Court Act, as read together in the cited rules set out in rule 2 of the interpretation of legal notice no 146 of 2016 of the Employment & Labour Relations Court (Procedure) Rules 2016 where it is interpreted in the rules unless the context so requires. 
That the petitioner has moved the Honourable Court in the present application, claim or complaint in the form of a petition which is a formal application made to the Court in accordance with the provisions of section 12(2) of the Employment & Labour Relations Court Act laws of Kenya seeking jurisdictional action against the respondent action for breach of his employment contract.",Khisa_v_Kenya_Plantation_and_Agricultural_Workers_Union_(Petition_E25 of 2023)_[2023] KEELRC 2943 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
37c55123ebc6-2,"That the decision in Communication Commission of Kenya & 5 others versus Royal Media Services Ltd Supreme Court of Kenya at Nairobi Petition no. 14 of 2014 together with the cited case of Francis Gathugu Vs. Kenyatta University Civil Appeal no. 279 of 2013 are all distinguishable from the present case in that the principle of avoidance was applicable in cited case laws. 
That the cited authorities are inapplicable in the instant case and the right case law applicable to this matter is United States International University Vs. Attorney General & 2 others (2012) eKLR equally Karisa Chengo & 2 others Vs. Republic Civil Appeal No. 44, 45 & 76 of 2014 (2015) eKLR and as held in the case of Owners of motor vessel ‘Lilian S’ v. Caltex Oil Kenya (1989) 1KLR1. 
That as a result of the authorities aforesaid, it is clear that the petition is sustainable against the respondent for breach of both the petitioner’s contractual and constitutional right to fair hearing and fair administrative action contemplated under Article 50(1) and (2). Article 47 of the constitution of Kenya as read together with the provisions of Rule 8(g), (h), (i) and (ii) of the respondent union constitution which raises triable issues that require the Court to probe and analyse facts of the case against each and every breach of right and fundamental freedom raised in the petition thereafter make a finding on the basis of its merit. 
That these are constitutional questions which the Court is seized with through the petition. The Court has jurisdictional authority to interpret and apply the constitutional issues raised in the present employment dispute and provide redress to violations of his constitutional rights in matters falling under its jurisdiction in line with the present case. 
That the preliminary objection filed is not on a point of law but raises a procedural technicality, an objection on the form used by the petitioner to approach the Court on a dispute of right to fair hearing, fair trial and right to due process of the law as opposed to the principle objective that established this court to effect substantive justice by facilitating the just, expeditious, efficient and proportionate resolution of disputes in line with section 3 of the Employment & Labour Relations Court Act.",Khisa_v_Kenya_Plantation_and_Agricultural_Workers_Union_(Petition_E25 of 2023)_[2023] KEELRC 2943 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
37c55123ebc6-3,"That under Article 159 of the Constitution of Kenya the Court is bound by mandatory terms to exercise its judicial authority without undue regard to procedural technicality such as the one raised in the preliminary objection filed by the respondent. 
The preliminary objection does not meet the threshold of what a preliminary objection is as outlined in the case of Mukisa Biscuits Co. Ltd Vs. West- end distributors ltd (1966) EA 696 and also as set out in Avatar Sing Bhamra & Another V. Oriental Commercial Bank, Kisumu High Court Civil case No. 53 of 2004. 
The parties filed their respective submissions. The court has considered the parties’ respective positions and makes finding as follows.
The only issue is whether the petition is trapped by the principle of constitutional avoidance. The answer lies largely in the pleadings. The petitioner has alleged violation of his rights and fundamental freedoms including Articles 41, 50(1) and 47 (1) of the Constitution as set out in paragraphs 36 to 45 of the petition. The petitioner prays for a declaration that his rights and fundamental freedoms were violated. How then can the Court decide the issues without taking evidence on the express alleged constitutional violations? It appears that as urged for the petitioner, the preliminary objection will collapse as whether rights and fundamental freedoms were violated is in dispute and is a matter which must go to full hearing and determined after taking evidence. The preliminary objection fails to pass the threshold and will fail.
In conclusion the preliminary objection dated 24.03.2023 is hereby dismissed with costs in the cause and parties to fix the matter for further directions for expeditious determination of the petition.
Signed, dated and delivered by video-link and in court at Nairobi this Friday 17th November, 2023.

The Applicant approached this court vide Notice of Motion dated 19th October 2023 seeking the following orders;
Spent
THAT the applicant be enjoined in this suit as an interested party. 
THAT ex-parte in the interim status quo be maintained. The status quo being that account number 0300181231321 at Equity Bank in the name of JOSEPH MALAKWEN ARAP SAMOEI is already frozen as has already been ordered in Eldoret Misc. Crim. Application No. E353 of 2023.

THAT the applicants be ordered to refund the total amount of money withdrawn from account number 0300181231321 at Equity bank belonging to Joseph Malakwen Samoei.
THAT costs of the application be in the cause.",In_re_Estate_of_Joseph_Malakwen_Samoei_(Deceased)_(Miscellaneous_Civil_Appeal_5 of 2023)_[2023] KEHC 25437 (KLR)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a72dba7cf5b2-1,"THAT costs of the application be in the cause. 
The Application is premised on the grounds set out therein and the contents of the supporting affidavit sworn by the Applicant.
The Applicant contends that she is the legal wife to Joseph Malakwen Samoei and that her consent was not sought by the applicants while obtaining the court order issued on 16.02.2023. According to her, the applicants hid material facts from the court thus making the court to arrive at an unjust decision. 
The applicant averred that the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei has been working as an administrative officer until when he retired at the age of 60 years in the year 2020. 
The applicant further averred that throughout the years the 1st applicant has been trying to make withdrawals from the bank account number 01245029415900 at National Bank and the same has been stopped on numerous occasions but he would still access the same since he has taken hold of the original identity card of Joseph Malakwen Samoei. 
It was the applicant’s averment that as a result of the 1st applicant’s meddling with the estate of Joseph Malakwen Samoei to the detriment of his family members, some altercations have led to violence when the said 1st applicant assaulted the applicant. 
The 1st applicant upon realizing that he had been barred from accessing the known bank account for Joseph Malakwen Samoei at National Bank, he devised a method of opening another account at equity bank wherein the retirement benefits of Joseph Malakwen Samoei were deposited. Upon being granted the court orders to manage the assets of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei, the 1st applicant immediately withdrew a total of Kshs. 2,800,000/= to the detriment of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei, the applicant and their children.
The applicant averred that upon realizing that the retirement benefits of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei did not reflect in his National Bank Account but to an unknown bank account at Equity Bank, she then reported the matter at the DCI offices in Eldoret which investigations led to the freezing of the said bank account at Equity.",In_re_Estate_of_Joseph_Malakwen_Samoei_(Deceased)_(Miscellaneous_Civil_Appeal_5 of 2023)_[2023] KEHC 25437 (KLR)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a72dba7cf5b2-2,"In response to the application, the 1st respondent averred that the court orders obtained by the applicant from this honourable court on 19.10.2023 were obtained through material non-disclosure and misrepresentation of several facts. It was his case that the orders issued on 21.7.2023 in Eldoret Misc. Application No. E353 of 2023 by Hon. D. Mikoyan (CM) were vacated by the said court on 4.10.2023 way before the application dated 19.10.2023 was filed contrary to crafty assertions made in paragraph 11 of her supporting affidavit dated 19.10.2023. 
The 1st respondent averred that the applicant approached the court with unclean hands by not disclosing that she had left one Joseph Malakwen Samoei and has been married to one Hillary Tuwei for the last twenty years since 2004 to date. Further that all children listed in a letter dated 111.10.2022 belong to one Hillary Tuwei and not Joseph Malakwen Samoei. 
The 1st respondent contended that he has been taking care of his brother since he became sick in the year 1999 and he stays with him at his place. That the applicant came into the picture when she got information that the retirement benefits of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei were released.  
The 1st respondent equally filed submissions in support of his response, in which he essentially submitted that pension monies are not matrimonial property and that if the applicant is appointed as he legal guardian of Joseph Malakwen, the court risks the property being misused by a party who has never cared to see the said Joseph Malakwen. 
Analysis & Determination
The court has carefully considered the application, response and submissions made by the respondent’s counsel. It is not in dispute that one Joseph Malakwen Samoei is suffering from a mental disorder. A letter dated 8th February, 2023 was adduced in evidence from Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital to confirm that fact. Section 2 of the Mental Health Act Cap 248 provides that:
“A person suffering from mental disorder” means a person who has been found to be suffering under this Act and includes a person diagnosed as a psychopathic person with mental illness and suffering from mental impairment due to alcohol or substance abuse.”",In_re_Estate_of_Joseph_Malakwen_Samoei_(Deceased)_(Miscellaneous_Civil_Appeal_5 of 2023)_[2023] KEHC 25437 (KLR)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a72dba7cf5b2-3,"The court is empowered to grant orders sought by the application in relation to custody, management and guardianship under Section 26 of the Mental Health Act Cap 248 which provides:
“(1) The court may make orders:
a) For the management of the estate of any person suffering from mental disorder, and
b) For the guardianship of any person suffering from mental disorder by any near relative or by any other suitable person
c) Where there is no known relative or other suitable person, the court may order that the Public Trustee be appointed manager of the estate and guardian of any such person.
d) Where upon inquiries it is found that the person to whom the inquiry relates is suffering from mental disorder to such an extent as to be incapable of managing his affairs, but that he is capable of managing himself and is not dangerous to himself or to others or likely to act in a manner offensive to public decency, the court may make such orders as it may think just for the management of the estate of such person, including proper provision for his maintenance and for the maintenance of such members of his family as are dependent upon him for maintenance, but need not, in such case, make any order as to the custody of the person suffering from mental disorder.” 
Additionally, the authority to manage affairs of an estate of a patient is donated under Section 27 of the Mental Health Act whereas Section 28 of the same Act provides for management of the subject's estate.
In applying Section 26 and 27 of Cap 248, I am guided by the case of Re N M K (2017) eKLR where it was held as follows: -
“In considering an application brought under sections 26 and 27 of the Mental Health Act, the Court is guided by three main factors: 
There must be medical evidence warranting the determination by the Court that the Subject suffers from mental disorder;
The person to be appointed to be either a Guardian or Manager must be fit to be so appointed;
The Court must be satisfied that a proposed Manager will utilize her powers for the benefit and welfare of the Subject.”
The similar position was held in in re Estate VFM (Patient) [2020] eKLR, the court held that:
a) For the court to grant the application for appointment of a manager of the estate and guardian to the patient, the Petitioner/Applicant is duty bound to prove that:",In_re_Estate_of_Joseph_Malakwen_Samoei_(Deceased)_(Miscellaneous_Civil_Appeal_5 of 2023)_[2023] KEHC 25437 (KLR)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a72dba7cf5b2-4,"b) There exists medical proof by show of evidence confirming that the subject suffers from mental disorder.
c) The petitioner/Applicant seeking to be appointed as manager or guardian must be legally fit to be so appointed.
d) That due to the subject’s mental disorder, he or she is incapable of managing his/her own affairs independently and responsibly.  
e) That the proposed manager/guardian will manage the subject’s property effectively and efficiently for the benefit of the estate and welfare of the subject.
The overall guiding principal in the application of all these factors is that it must be in the best interest of the subject. 
Based on the pleadings and the evidence presented, I a persuaded that the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei lacks the mental capacity which my view falls within the definition of Section 2 Cap 248. The same has affected his cognition and the ability to take care of his affairs or of himself. 
The issue having been settled; I shall then turn to determine whether the interested party should be appointed as guardian/ manager to the patient and the orders issued on 16.2.2023 appointing the respondents as the guardians be set aside. Section 26 of the Act as mentioned above, gives court the power to make an order regarding management of the estate of any person suffering from mental disorder to any relative or any person suitable but giving preference to a relative.
In the present case, the applicant averred that she is the legal wife of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei having gotten married to him on 17.8.1991. I have however noted that the applicant has not indicated anywhere or proved cohabitation with the patient in the recent past and visited him where is ordinarily resides. The 1st respondent averred that the interested third party applicant left the patient and married one Hillary Tuwei, a fact that has not been disputed. The 1st respondent further averred that he has been taking care of his brother and that he has always accompanied him whenever he is going to collect his salary.
There is no indication from the applicant that he has ever been available for the patient to take good care of him. She has only relied on the fact that they were married years ago.",In_re_Estate_of_Joseph_Malakwen_Samoei_(Deceased)_(Miscellaneous_Civil_Appeal_5 of 2023)_[2023] KEHC 25437 (KLR)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
a72dba7cf5b2-5,"Having said so, it is clear that the Applicant has not received the full consent of the rest of the patient’s family. For the court to intervene in the management and control of the patient’s properties and estate the court has to put into consideration the provisions of Section 28 through to Section 39 of the Mental Health Act.   In particular, Section 33 requires a manager(s) so appointed by the court to furnish an inventory and annual accounts to the court and the Public Trustee. 
In the upshot, the court finds it proper to appoint the respondents to be the managers of the estate of the patient as the third party applicant becomes the patient’s guardian as enumerated hereunder: - 
i. That the third party/applicant is hereby appointed as the guardian of Joseph Malakwen Samoei, the patient herein suffering mental disorder in as far as the patient’s personal and medical care and maintenance is concerned.
ii. That respondents are jointly appointed managers of the estate of Joseph Malakwen Samoei and do furnish the court with an inventory of the estate of Joseph Malakwen Samoei of all his assets and liabilities within 30 days from today’s date for purposes of determination of the management of the patient’s estate.
It is so ordered.

 (Being an appeal from the Ruling and Order of Hon. E. K. Usui, SPM dated 25th February 2019 at the Magistrates Court at Nairobi, Milimani in Civil Case No. 6314 of 2018) 
JUDGMENT
This is an appeal from the ruling dated 25.02.2019 in which the trial magistrate allowed the Respondent’s application to strike out the defence under Order 2 Rule 15(1) (a) and (c) of the Civil Procedure Rules. The trial magistrate after setting out the principles for striking out in Tom Odhiambo Achilla t/a Achilla T.O. and Co. Advocates v Kenneth Wachira Akide t/a Akide and Co. Advocates and Others [2015]eKLR stated as follows:
I have read out the Plaint and the Defence filed in court.  I have also read the counter-claim between the parties prior to filing the suit. I am satisfied that the defendant’s defence is confused of mere denial circuses to triable issues. The application has merit. It is allowed as prayed.
The thrust of the Appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal dated 21.05.2019, is that the Ruling is devoid of substance, does not set the legal and factual basis and the analysis leading to the decision this resulting in a miscarriage of justice. The parties have filed written submissions in the matter which I have considered. 
It is not in dispute that power to strike out a claim is drastic and must be exercised with great circumspection. This is the Court of Appeal has stated many times. In D.T. Dobie & Company (Kenya) Ltd v Muchina [1982] KLR 1 it expressed the view that:",Kwacha_Group_of_Companies_v_Vending_Services_(Civil_Appeal_154 of 2019)_[2023] KEHC 25377 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
78e1fba5d264-1,"No suit ought to be summarily dismissed unless it appears so hopeless that it plainly and obviously discloses no reasonable cause of action and is so weak as to be beyond redemption and incurable by amendment. If a suit shows a mere semblance of a cause of action, provided it can be injected with real life by amendment, it ought to be allowed to go forward for a court of justice ought not to act in darkness without the full facts of a case before it.
In deciding whether to strike out the suit, the Court is required to examine the pleadings; the Plaint and Defence together with depositions in support of and in opposition to the application to strike out in order to determine whether there is a triable issue.
In this case, it is not apparent from the Ruling that the trial magistrate considered the Respondent’s claim and the Appellant’s statement of defence. A perusal of the plaint dated 02.07.2018 shows that the Respondent’s claim was for goods sold and delivered. The Respondent claimed Kshs. 520,026.00 with interest at commercial rates. In the defence dated 17.08.2018, the Appellant denied that it owed Kshs. 520,026.00. It averred that the services and goods were neither rendered nor delivered and that there was no factual basis for the claim.
The Respondent lodged the Notice of Motion dated 05.09.2018 seeking to strike out the defence. The application was supported by the affidavit of Neel Shah sworn on 02.07.2018 comprising statements of account, credit application form and emails. The Appellant filed grounds of opposition dated 08.01.2018 stating that the defence had triable issues. Unfortunately, the trial magistrate failed to engage with the pleadings and documents as it is difficult to know how the court came to the conclusion that those were not triable issues.",Kwacha_Group_of_Companies_v_Vending_Services_(Civil_Appeal_154 of 2019)_[2023] KEHC 25377 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
78e1fba5d264-2,"The fundamental rule governing decisions of any trial is that the ultimate decisions must set out reasons for the conclusion. The trial magistrate failed to explain why she came to the conclusion that the defence is comprised of mere denials and raises no triable issues. The duty to provide reasons is not only a function of due process but also abides by the rules of natural justice, particularly the right to a fair hearing which demands that parties know without any doubt why they won or lost, as without any reasons a losing party will not be able to know whether the court has misdirected itself and make a decision on whether they have a chance on appeal (see Flanner v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd (200) ALL ER 27, Mufrank Builders Limited v Kiriti Women Transport And Housing Co-Operative Society [2015] eKLR and Hellen Wangari Wangechi v Carumera Muthoni Gathua [2015] eKLR).
The duty to provide reasons is found in Order 21 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules which expressly provides that judgments “shall contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision.” This position was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Judicial Service Commission v Ndururi [2021] KECA 365 (KLR).
The Ruling appealed from was devoid of any reasons for the conclusion reached by the trial magistrate. In the circumstances, I allow the Appeal and order as follows:
The Ruling and Order dated 25.02.2019 is set aside and substituted with an order dismissing the Respondent’s application dated 05.09.2018.
The Respondent shall bear the costs of this Appeal assessed as Ksh. 20,000.00.
The suit, Milimani CMCC No. 6314 of 2018, be and is hereby transferred to the Milimani Small Claims Court for hearing and determination.

Section 211 of the Criminal Procedure Code was complied with, the accused opted to give an unsworn statement and called two witnesses.",Republic_v_Langat_(Criminal_Case_14 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25401 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a8dfcc6779a0-6,"Gideon Cheruiyot Langat (Dw.1) in his defence stated that he could not recall the events of the material day, citing mental illness, he stated that he was under medication, however at the time, was not taking medication due to financial challenges.
Emily Ngeno (Dw.2) stated that the accused is her brother and that he has been epileptic since childhood and whenever he would get epileptic seizures, he would turn violent.
Nancy Wendot (Dw. 3) a senior clinical officer at Kericho County Referral Hospital stated that she was in possession of a mental status examination report in respect of the accused which was done on 9th July, 2018, in the said report it was noted that the accused was an epileptic. She stated that when the accused was brought in for the mental assessment, he told her that he had slashed his wife with a slasher and she came to the conclusion that the accused was not of sound mind and that there are two other mental status reports that were consistent with her report, she produced the reports as DExh. 1 (a) and (b). She also stated that persons who suffer from epileptic fits also do abnormal acts.
On cross examination, Dw. 3 confirmed that epilepsy can be managed by medical treatment and that epilepsy is a convulsion disorder.
On re-examination, Dw. 3 stated that epileptic patients at times turn out to be mental patients.
Mr. Nyadimo Learned Counsel representing the accused herein filed submissions in which he argued the defence of insanity.
He cited section 9 of the Penal Code CAP 63 Laws of Kenya which prescribes that a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his will, or for an event which occurs by accident.
The Learned Counsel relied on the following cases in support of the defence of insanity Leonard Mwangani Munyasia v Republic (2015) eKLR in which the court stated as follows; “It is a rule of universal application and of criminal responsibility that a man cannot be condemned if it is proved that at the time of the offence he was not a master of his mind.”",Republic_v_Langat_(Criminal_Case_14 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25401 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a8dfcc6779a0-7,"The Learned Counsel relied on the case of Richard Chemagong v Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 150 of 1983 where the Court of Appeal made reference to the McNaughten rules and sought to distinguish a malfunctioning of the mind from non-functioning of the mind due to epilepsy and held that there was ample evidence that the defendant therein was acting unconsciously and involuntarily when he inflicted the injury.
The Learned Counsel finally submitted that it was trite law that in order to establish a defence on the ground of insanity it must be proven that at the time of committing the act the accused was labouring under a defect of reason and cited section 166 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code CAP 75 Laws of Kenya to buttress his argument, the said provision states as follows; “Where an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence, and it is given in evidence on the trial of that person for that offence that he was insane so as not to be responsible for his acts or omissions at the time when the act was done or the omission made, then if it appears to the court before which the person is tried that he did the act or made the omission charged but was insane at the time he did or made it, the court shall make a special finding to the effect that the accused was guilty of the act or omission charged but was insane when he did the act or made the omission.”
The sole issue for consideration is whether the prosecution proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
The offence of murder is provided for in section 203 of the Penal Code that provides as follows; “Any person who of malice aforethought causes death of another person by an unlawful act or omission is guilty of murder.” In Republic v Andrew Omwenga [2009] eKLR the court held: “It is clear from this definition that for an accused person to be convicted of murder, it must be proved that he caused the death of the deceased with malice aforethought by an unlawful act or omission – there are therefore three ingredients of murder which the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt in order to secure a conviction. They are: (a) The death of the deceased and the cause of the death, (b) That the accused committed the unlawful act which caused the death of the deceased and (c) That the accused had the malice aforethought.”",Republic_v_Langat_(Criminal_Case_14 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25401 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a8dfcc6779a0-8,"The accused in this case was charged with the offence of murder contrary to section 203 of the penal code which defines murder as the unlawful killing of a person or persons with malice aforethought. 
(a) Death and Cause of Death
In this case the death of the deceased persons is not disputed, on the material night three lifeless bodies were found in the house of the accused person according to the eyewitness accounts of Pw. 1, Pw. 2, Pw. 3 and Pw. 4. 
On 9th July, 2018 Dr. Sammy Langat (Pw. 7) conducted post mortem examinations on the three deceased persons, his observations were that the deceased persons had sustained multiple cut wounds on the head and his findings were that the cause of death of all the three deceased persons was severe head injury and produced the post mortem reports as PExh. 2, 3 and 4.
Whether the accused committed the unlawful act which caused the death of the deceased
I am aware that there were no eyewitnesses to the assault of the deceased persons, as most of the prosecution witnesses testified that on the material night, they gathered outside the house of the accused after they heard commotion from the accused persons house, the house was locked and the crowd wanted to break in when the accused opened the door, came out of the house while swaying a panga and ran towards the river. When they entered the house, they stumbled upon the lifeless bodies of the deceased and it dawned on them that the accused had killed three people. I find that the accused persons' defence of insanity does not hold water in the circumstances of the offence and further that the fact that he suffers from epilepsy cannot explain the cold hearted murders and the callous and cavalier attitude after he committed the instant office. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused person who unlawfully caused the deceased's death.
Whether the Accused Person had Malice Aforethought.",Republic_v_Langat_(Criminal_Case_14 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25401 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a8dfcc6779a0-9,"Whether the Accused Person had Malice Aforethought.
 For the charge of murder to succeed, it must be proved that they acted with malice aforethought. Section 206 of the Penal Code provides circumstances from which malice aforethought may be inferred. They are: ""(a) An intention to cause death of or to do grievous harm to any person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not; (b)Knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of or grievous harm to some person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be cause;© An intention to commit a felony;(d)…"" In Republic v Tubere S/O Ochen [1945] 12 EACA 63 the court held that:- “an inference of malice aforethought can be established by considering the nature of the weapon used, the part of the body targeted, the manner in which the weapon was used and the conduct of the accused before, during and after the attack.” Having considered the brief facts of this case, I find that the accused person herein had malice aforethought, the accused used a jembe and a panga to assault the hapless victims in the wee hours of the night and whilst assaulting them targeted their heads and soon after he had inflicted fatal injuries, fled the scene of the crime, he was apprehended the following morning as he sought refuge at a nearby secondary school.
I do take cognizance of the fact that there are no eye witness accounts to the events leading to the demise of the deceased, however, I find that circumstantial evidence points to the culpability of the deceased. In Sawe v Rep [2003] KLR 364, the Court of Appeal expressed as follows: “In order to justify on circumstantial evidence, the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. There must be no other co-existing circumstances weakening the chain of circumstances relied upon. The burden of proving facts that justify the drawing of this inference from the facts to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis of innocence remains with the prosecution. It is a burden which never shifts to the party accused.”",Republic_v_Langat_(Criminal_Case_14 of 2018)_[2023] KEHC 25401 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a8dfcc6779a0-10,"Accordingly, I find that the defence put forward by the accused person namely:  Gideon Cheruiyot Langat does not displace the prosecution’s case. The prosecution has therefore proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and in the premises, I find the accused person guilty for the offence of Murder Contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. The accused person is hereby convicted.

 (Being an appeal from the Judgment and Decree of Hon. D.W. Mburu, SPM dated 29th January 2021 at the Magistrates Court at Nairobi, Milimani in Civil Case No. 1722 of 2019) 
JUDGMENT
This appeal is against the trial court’s judgment on quantum. The Respondent was injured in a road traffic accident that took place on 17.10.2017 while he was walking along the road when he was knocked down by the Appellant’s motor vehicle registration number KAW 701W. After hearing the case, the trial magistrate found the Appellant fully liable and awarded the Respondent Kshs. 850,000.00 and Kshs. 143,530.00 as general and special damages respectively. It is the award of general damages that has precipitated this appeal.",Kelvin_v_Runyambo_(Civil_Appeal_E091 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25388 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
6031f495e30a-1,"According to the Plaint dated 17.03.2018, the Respondent pleaded that he sustained a mid-shaft fracture of the left tibia and fibula and suffered a swollen tender and painful leg. In his testimony the Respondent confirmed these injuries. He produced a Discharge Summary from PCEA Kikuyu Hospital showing that he was admitted to the hospital on 19.12.2017 and discharged on 22.12.2017 for treatment of the left leg injury. The Respondent was also examined by Dr G. K. Mwaura on 04.01.2019 who prepared a report of even date. Dr Mwaura examined the P3 Medical Report, Discharge Summary, booking sheet and X-ray request form from Kiambu Level 4 Hospital. He confirmed that the Respondent suffered a fracture of the left tibia and fibula which was treated initially by application of plaster of paris and the tibia fracture fixed by a K-nail. When he was examined, the Respondent was heathy and normal. Dr Mwaura noted that the Respondent experiences pain on the left leg upon exertion and cannot walk or stand for a long time. He classified the injury as grievous harm and assessed permanent degree of incapacity at 10%.
In support of his plea to be awarded Kshs. 1,000,000.00, the Respondent cited several cases. In Hussein Abdi Hashi v Hassan Noor [2004] eKLR where the plaintiff sustained a fracture of the left malleoulus and metatarsal and laceration to the ankle, his incapacity was assessed at 20%. He was awarded Kshs. 800,000.00. In Abdi Salaan Nuron v Kenya Tea Development Authority  KRC HCCC No. 26 of 1999 (UR), the plaintiff was awarded Kshs. 800,000.00 after sustaining a fracture of the right tibia and fibula. He also cited Savco Stores Limited v David Mwangi Kimotho [2008] eKLR where the plaintiff suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula, fractured left elbow and deep cut on the forehead. He suffered permanent disability at 20% and was awarded Kshs. 800,000.00/",Kelvin_v_Runyambo_(Civil_Appeal_E091 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25388 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
6031f495e30a-2,"The Appellant urged the court to award Kshs. 300,000.00. It cited Civicon Limited v Richard Njomo Omwancha and 2 others [2019]eKLR. The court reduced an award of Kshs. 1,000,000.00 to Kshs. 450,000.00 for the 3rd plaintiff who suffered a fracture of the right tibia fibula, fracture of four upper teeth, cut wound on the upper and lower lip, swollen and tender upper lip, bruises on the chin, dislocation of the left shoulder and bruises on the right thigh. In Gladys Lyaka Mwombe v Francis Namatsi and 2 Others [2019]eKLR the plaintiff was awarded Kshs. 300,000.00 for sustaining a fracture of the lower tibia and fibula, a cut wound on the anterior part of the scalp, a head injury, spinal cord injury, neck injury and a cut wound on the face. 
In making the award, the trial magistrate found that the authorities cited by the Respondent were relevant and involved comparable injuries to those the plaintiff had sustained hence the award of Kshs. 850,000.00 would be appropriate for pain and suffering. 
The parties are agreed on the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the Respondent. The issue presented in this appeal as stated in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 24.11.2021 is whether the award was inordinately high and excessive in light of the injuries sustained by the Respondent. 
As this is an appeal on quantum of damages, the appellate court can only intervene if it is shown that the trial court, in awarding of the damages, took into consideration an irrelevant fact or the sum awarded is inordinately low or too high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage, or it should be established that a wrong principle of law was applied (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349).",Kelvin_v_Runyambo_(Civil_Appeal_E091 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25388 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
6031f495e30a-3,"This appeal concerns the award of general damages. General damages are damages at large and the court does the best it can in reaching an award that reflects the nature and gravity of the injuries. In assessing damages, the general method of approach should be that comparable injuries should as far as possible be compensated by comparable awards but it must be recalled that no two cases are exactly alike (see Stanley Maore v Geoffrey Mwenda NYR CA Civil Appeal No. 147 of 2002 [2004]eKLR). In addition, the current value of the shilling and the economy have to be taken into account and although astronomical awards must be avoided, the court must ensure that awards make sense and result in fair compensation (see Ugenya Bus Service v Gachoki NKU CA Civil Appeal No. 66 of 1981 [1982]eKLR and Jabane v Olenja [1986] KLR 661).
It is not in dispute that the Appellant sustained a fracture of the left tibia and fibula together with soft tissue injuries. The injuries have healed but have left him with difficulty in walking and permanent disability assessed at 10%. Looking at the cases cited by the Respondent before the trial court, I note that the victims therein suffered more serious and greater disability. Although the cases cited by the Respondent were decided in 2004 and 2008, those cited by the Appellant were more recent and reflective of the trend of damages awarded in cases of where the victims sustained similar injuries. 
Since the award of general damages was excessive, this court is entitled to intervene. I therefore set aside the award of Kshs. 1,000,000.00 and substitute with an award of Kshs. 600,000.00.
I allow the appeal to the extent that I set aside the award of general damages and substitute it with an award of Kshs. 600,000.00. The said sum shall accrue interest at court rates from the date of judgment in the subordinate court. 
The Appellant shall have costs of the appeal assessed at Kshs. 30,000.00.

(Being an Appeal on the whole Judgment of Hon. F. N. Kyambia – CM at Mombasa delivered on 23rd July 2021 in CM ELRC 933 of 2019)
J U D G M E N T
The Appellant was the Claimant in Mombasa CM ELR Case No. 933 of 2019 whereby she had sued the Respondent herein vide a memorandum of claim dated 29/10/2019 and filed in Court on 30/10/2019.  The Appellant sought the following orders:-

costs of the suit and interest.
The Appellant had pleaded that she had been employed by the Respondent in 2007 and was earning ksh. 9000 per month at the time of termination on 30/8/2018.  That the termination was without justifiable cause, and was effected unfairly without following due process laid down in law, and without paying the Appellant’s dues.",Nyandika_v_Inter_Security_Services_(Appeal_E048 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2950 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
8ccdf6146812-1,"Documents filed by the Appellant together with the memorandum of claim included the Appellant’s NSSF statement covering the period 2008 upto August 2018, employment identification card, a demand letter, response to the demand and the Appellant’s bank statements.
The Respondent defended the suit vide a memorandum of response dated 30/1/2020 and filed in Court on 3/2/2020.  The Respondent denied the Appellant’s claim and pleaded that the Appellant had been employed by the Respondent as a day security guard and was deployed at  various duty stations, the last one having been National Museums of Kenya Mombasa, whose contract with the Respondent expired on 31/7/2018.  That the Respondent issued the Claimant with a termination notice on 29/6/2018.
The Respondent further pleaded that it separated with the Appellant lawfully and paid her dues; including her salary for July 2018.  The Respondent further pleaded that the Appellant’s salary included an element for accommodation, that the Appellant was paid in lieu of leave and public holidays.
The Respondent further pleaded that it separated with the Appellant on 31/7/2018, and she instituted suit in the trial Court on 30/10/2019; and that accordingly; the Appellant’s claim for continuing injury (namely underpayment, house allowance, unpaid leave days, unpaid holidays and payments of deductions) are statutorily time barred.
Documents filed by the Respondent together with the Memorandum of Response included a notice of termination dated 29/6/2018, termination letter dated 29/6/2018 and response letter dated 26/8/2018.",Nyandika_v_Inter_Security_Services_(Appeal_E048 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2950 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
8ccdf6146812-2,"At the trial, the Appellant testified that she worked for the Respondent for 10 years, working from 6.00am to 6.00pm, working on holidays, without leave and without overtime payment.  That after work on 31/8/2018, she received a call from her boss who told her not to go to work.  That she nevertheless went to work on 1/9/2018 and found another person.  That she was not given either a termination notice or letter and that she has not received the letters shown to be dated 29/6/2018.  The Appellant adopted her filed witness statement as her testimony.
Cross-examined, the Appellant testified that she was not given a contract during the 10 years she worked, that she had not seen the letters dated 29/6/2018 and 26/8/2018 respectively; and that she was not privy to any contract between the Respondent and National Museums of Kenya.
The Respondent on the other hand called one witness (RW-1) who adopted his filed witness statement as his testimony and produced in evidence documents filed by the Respondents.  RW-1 further testified that the Appellant worked with the Respondent as a day security guard from 2008 to 2018, was issued with a termination notice, and that her salary, which she had agreed to, included house allowance.  The Respondent denied the Appellant’s assertion that she never took leave and testified that the Appellant was duly compensated for holidays worked, and that NSSF and NHIF dues were duly submitted.  That the Appellant was fairly terminated.
Cross-examined, the Respodnent (RW-1) admitted that the Respondent had not produced in Court the Appellant’s contract, and had also not produced any leave application forms and had not produced payslips to show that the Appellant had been paid for holidays worked.  RW-1 further admitted that the letters produced by the Respondent in evidence had nothing to show that they had been received by the Appellant.",Nyandika_v_Inter_Security_Services_(Appeal_E048 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2950 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
8ccdf6146812-3,"The trial Court delivered its judgment on 23/7/2021 and returned a finding that the Appellant had been fairly terminated upon being given a termination notice and notice of impending termination following the expiry of a contract between the Respondent and National Museums of Kenya.  The trial Court further made a finding that the Appellant had failed to prove her claim against the Respondent, and dismissed the same in its entirety with costs to the Respondent.
Aggrieved by the said judgment, the Appellant preferred the present appeal and set forth the following grounds of appeal:-
the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in dismissing the Appellant’s appeal.
the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering the oral evidence by the Appellant and the Respondent adduced in Court regarding the claim in question.
the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider evidence and submissions presented by the Appellant in considering the claim in question.
the Learned Magistrate’s judgment was against the weight of the need to dispense justice with fairness, and thus bad in law.
The Appellant is seeking the following reliefs:-
that the appeal be allowed with costs.
that the trial Court’s judgment in CM ELR Cause no. 933 of 2019 delivered on 23/7/2021 by Hon. F.N. Kyambia (MR) Chief Magistrate be set aside.
that an award be entered in favour  of the Appellant.
that costs of the appeal be awarded to the Appellant.
This is a first appeal.  The entire case as presented before the trial Court is open to fresh consideration.  A first Appellate Court is empowered to subject the whole of the evidence adduced in the trial Court to fresh and exhaustive scrutiny and to make conclusions about it; bearing in mind that it did not have the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses first hand.  This duty was stated in SELLE & ANTOEHR -VS- ASSOCIATED MOTOR BOAT CO. LTD & OTHERS [1968] EA 123.
Upon considering the pleadings filed and evidence presented  in the trial Court, issues that present for determination, in my view, are:-
whether termination of the Appellant’s employment was unfair.
whether the Appellant is entitled to the reliefs sought in the trial Court.",Nyandika_v_Inter_Security_Services_(Appeal_E048 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2950 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
8ccdf6146812-4,"whether the Appellant is entitled to the reliefs sought in the trial Court.
On the first issue, it was a common ground that the Appellant was employed by the Respondent as a day security guard in 2008, and worked for ten years (until 2018) and that she was earning ksh. 9,000 per month at the time of termination of her employment.  The Appellant testified that she was not given a contract, that she worked until 31/8/2018 and that while at home, she was called by her boss and told not to go to work.  That she nevertheless went to work on 1/9/2018 but found another person.  That she was not served with a termination notice or a termination letter; and had not been notified of any impending termination.  That she had not seen the letters dated 29/6/2018 and 26/8/2018 which the Respondent produced in Court.
The Respondent, on the other part, admitted that there was nothing on record to show that the letters (notices) dated 29/6/2018 on termination of the Appellant’s employment and termination of the Respondent’s contract with National Museums of Kenya had been served on the Appellant.  The Respondent did not, therefore, rebut the Appellant’s evidence that she was not informed of any impending termination of employment, and was not issued with a termination notice.
Failure by an employer to issue a termination notice under Section 35(1) (c) of the Employment Act renders termination of an employee’s employment unlawful, and therefore unfair.  On this account, I find and hold that termination of the Appellant’s employment was unfair, and I so declare.
The trial Court fell into error by holding that the Appellant had been given a termination notice when the alleged termination notice was not shown to have been received by and/or served on the Appellant, and when even the Respondent’s witness admitted in evidence that the Respodnent had nothing to show that the alleged notice had been received by the Appellant.",Nyandika_v_Inter_Security_Services_(Appeal_E048 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2950 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
8ccdf6146812-5,"On the second issue, and having made a finding that termination of the Appellant’s employment was unfair, and taking into consideration the circumstances in which the Appellant’s employment was terminated, I award the Appellant the equivalent of ten months’ salary in compensation for unfair termination of employment; that is ksh. 9000x10 = ksh. 90,000.
The claim for one month salary in lieu of notice is allowed at ksh. 9,000 as the Appellant never demonstrated that she was entitled to salary at a higher rate.  She never pleaded with particulars the relevant minimum wage guidelines for any particular periods of time during the employment period.  the Court cannot act on general allegations.  Further, no evidence was adduced by the Appellant to demonstrate entitlement to a higher rate of salary.
Further, and as correctly pleaded by the Respondent, the claims for salary underpayment, unpaid house allowance, unpaid leave and  unpaid holidays are in the nature of continuing injury as contemplated in Section 90 of the Employment Act.  Action on such claims should be brought within twelve months upon ceasation thereof.  In the present case, the ceasation date was the date of termination of the Appellant’s employment, which was 31/8/2018 according to the Appellant’s pleadings and evidence.
The Appellant’s suit in the trial Court was filed on 30/10/2019, over twelve months from the date of ceassation/termination.  Whether proved at trial or not, such claims were/are statute bared, and cannot be considered by this Court.  I uphold the trial Court’s dismissal of the same, though for different reasons.
The claim for severance pay cannot be allowed as termination of the Appellant’s employment did not result from redundancy.",Nyandika_v_Inter_Security_Services_(Appeal_E048 of 2021)_[2023] KEELRC 2950 (KLR)_(16 November 2023)_(Judgment)
8ccdf6146812-6,"The claim for unremitted deductions was not proved, and cannot be granted.  I have severally stated, and I repeat it here, that once statutory deductions are made from an employee’s salary by an employer, such deductions cease to be the property of the employee.  The deductions become the property and right of the statutory bodies on whose account the deductions are made.

 PW1 adopted his Witness Statement  dated 30th April 2018 and produced the documents in the list of documents as Pex No 1 to 18 save for the valuation report.
 PW1 stated that he was at all material times the registered lessee of all that piece of land Portion No. 5546 delineated on Survey Plan No. 158373, C.R. No. 23699 situate in Malindi Township within Kilifi County.  He further stated that he purchased the suit land from the 1st Defendant  on 20th December 1993, paid a consideration of  Kshs. 145,000/- and a transfer in his favour duly registered on 31st December 1993. 
PW1 testified that subsequently, and upon the requisite building approvals from the then Municipal Council, he  constructed a double storey building which he managed to rent out to five tenants earning  a total of Kshs. 28,675/- monthly rental income in   January 2018. 
 It was PW1’s evidence that he enjoyed quiet possession until the morning of 12th February 2018 when the 1st Defendant without notice wrongfully entered the suit property, evacuated the tenants and demolished the building. As a result of what he referred to as wrongful demolition, the Plaintiff alleged that the building has since become inhabitable causing him substantial loss and anguish. 
 The Plaintiff withdrew the suit against the 2nd Defendant vide a Notice to Withdraw dated 4th July 2019.
On cross-examination by Mr. Awino, PW1 testified that he developed the suit land between 2002 and 2003 and spent about Kshs.  12-13million but he did not have the receipts to show in court. He stated that half of the building was demolished and was not agreeable to the 1st Defendant rebuilding the half unless they put up a fresh one. 
 PW2 Edwin Otieno Oduor, a professional Valuer conducted a valuation on the suit land and prepared and produced the valuation report dated 5th April 2018. On cross-examination by Mr. Baraza, counsel for the 1st Defendant, PW2 told the court that the demolition affected the foundation of the building and the walls.

8df1a77d473b-2,"DEFENDANT’S CASE
 DW1 Joshua Odege Sanduk a licenced Surveyor adopted his Witness Statement dated 1st July 2019 and stated that he had been an employee of the 1st Defendant for 13 years. He testified that the damage on the building occurred as collateral damage during execution of a court order and  indicated that the 1st Defendant was willing to restore the building to its original state and that they be allowed to do so.
 DW1 confirmed on cross-examination by Mr. Binyenya, that the suit land belonged to the Plaintiff and that the 1st Defendant made a mistake demolishing the building. 
       PLAINTIFF’S SUBMISSION
Mr. Binyenya counsel for the Plaintiff filed submissions and largely reiterated the facts established in the parties’ pleadings and evidence adduced in court. He submitted that the Plaintiff was entitled to damages for loss and injury suffered. 
It was  counsel’s submissions that  the general rule regarding the measure of damages was that the injured party ought to be awarded a sum so as to put him in a position similar or nearly close to the position he would have been had he not sustained the loss. 
Counsel relied on the cases of   Total Kenya Limited formerly Caltex Oil Kenya Limited v Janevams Limited [2015] eKLR; and Peter M. Kariuki v Attorney General [2014] eKLR.
     ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION
It was undisputed that the Plaintiff was the rightful owner of the suit land and building thereon. The 1st Defendant admitted that they indeed wrongfully demolished the Plaintiff’s building. It follows therefore that the sole issue for determination in this case is whether the Plaintiff is entitled to damages and costs of this suit as prayed.
Under Section 13(7) of the Environment and Land Court Act No.19 of 2011, the Court has jurisdiction as follows:-
In exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act, the Court shall have power to make any order or grant, any relief as the Court deems fit and just including:-
a) Interim or permanent preservation orders including injunction.
b) Prerogative orders
c) Award of damages
d) Compensation
e) Specific performance
f) Restitution
g) Declarations or
h) Costs.",Kadir_v_National_Housing_Corporation_&_another_(Environment_and_Land_Case_Civil_Suit_98 of 2018)_[2023] KEELC 21582 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
8df1a77d473b-3,"e) Specific performance
f) Restitution
g) Declarations or
h) Costs.
The Plaintiff sought special damages in the sum of Kshs. 12,000,000/- indicating that being the sum expended in constructing the building back in the year 2002. Special damages must be specifically pleaded and   proved.
  In the case of  Swalleh C. Kariuki & another v Viloet Owiso Okuyu [2021] eKLR   the court held that :
“Special Damages must be both pleaded and proved, before they can be awarded by the Court. Suffice it to quote from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Hahn V. Singh, Civil Appeal No. 42 Of 1983 [1985] KLR 716, at P. 717, and 721 where the Learned Judges of Appeal - Kneller, Nyarangi JJA, and Chesoni Ag. J.A. - held:
“Special damages must not only be specifically claimed (pleaded) but also strictly proved…. for they are not the direct natural or probable consequence of the act complained of and may not be inferred from the act. The degree of certainty and particularity of proof required depends on the circumstances and nature of the acts themselves.”
 The Plaintiff’s documentary evidence in support of the special damages is a bill of quantities for a proposed residential house on Plot No. 5546. On perusal of that document, it shows that the document was prepared in February 2018 yet the construction was done back in 2002. Again, the total estimation was calculated at Kshs. 12,884,745/-. It is not explained why the Plaintiff would then claim only a sum of Kshs. 12,000,000/- out of that amount. 
The Plaintiff conceded in his testimony that he did not have any receipts in support of the construction expenses. I thus find that the prayer for special damages in the sum of Kshs. 12,000,000/- has not been proved.",Kadir_v_National_Housing_Corporation_&_another_(Environment_and_Land_Case_Civil_Suit_98 of 2018)_[2023] KEELC 21582 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
8df1a77d473b-4,"The Plaintiff also prayed for loss of future earnings in the form of rental income at the rate of Kshs. 31,000/-. In the case of Douglas Kalafa Ombeva v David Ngama [2013] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held that loss of earnings is a special damage claim, and as already established, it is paramount that special damages are pleaded and proved. The Plaintiff pleaded that the rental statement for January 2018 from his five tenants amounted to Kshs. 31,000/-. The Plaintiff explained that his estate agents Malindi Real Agency Limited would deduct 8 percent from the rent collected.
 The Plaintiff exhibited a copy of an account statement dated 10th February 2018 from the said Agents establishes that the Plaintiff’s rental income for the month of January 2018 was indeed Kshs. 31,000/-. In the circumstances, I find that the Plaintiff is entitled to prayer to the rental income as prayed.
In the alternative, the Plaintiff sought compensatory damages based on full repayment value of the building prior to the demolition together with unencumbered open market value of the suit land in the sum of Kshs. 30 million. The expert evidence produced by the Plaintiff was not controverted by the 1st Defendant. I will therefore rely on the valuation report exhibited by PW2. 
PW2 observed that the building was situated in a fast developing neighborhood identified as Ngala Phase 4 within Malindi Town. He also established that the part demolition affected the building’s foundation and therefore was not habitable. That the building could not be renovated due to the major damage caused. He estimated the market value of the building at Kshs. 30,000,000/-. 
The evidence on record established that the demolition did not affect the suit land. In the absence of any other valuation report to rebut the one on record, I am inclined to award compensatory damages as pleaded. In any event, the 1st Defendant conceded to their willingness to compensate the Plaintiff for the loss caused.
I therefore find that the Plaintiff has partially  proved his case and make the following specific orders;
A declaration that the Plaintiff is the genuine and rightful owner of portion No. 5546 Malindi.",Kadir_v_National_Housing_Corporation_&_another_(Environment_and_Land_Case_Civil_Suit_98 of 2018)_[2023] KEELC 21582 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)

JUDGMENT
Through   a certificate of urgency filed   on 22th April 2022 the petitioner   filed a Notice of Motion   together    with the petition   on the basis   that his rights     under Articles, 23, 24 & 25, read together   with Article   50(2)   have been violated - that Section 3 and 4 (2)   of the Probation of Offenders Act   are applicable   to him and that Section 333 of the Criminal Procedure Code should    be applied   to him.  
I have perused   the petition, the    affidavit    in support, the record in HCCRA 2/2019.
The petitioner was charged   with three   counts of   Sexual   Assault   Contrary to Section 5(1) (a) (1) (2) of the Sexual Offences Act.",Masesi_v_Republic_(Constitutional_Petition_127 of 2022)_[2023] KEHC 25430 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
a2a823d70dc8-1,"He was convicted   and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment    on each count to run concurrently on 17th December 2018 in Kilungu MC SOA 18/18.
He then filed an appeal - HCCRA 2/19.
On 11th October 2019 the High Court   dismissed his appeal against the   conviction and sentence - and directed that the sentence to run from the date of his arrest.  
In support of his petition   the petitioner filed submissions on 6th October 2022.  He submitted   that he was an old man “to   waste all those years in custody” and was seeking a non-custodial   sentence.  
He urged the court to set him free. 
On its   part the state objected to the petition -  that the petitioner   had filed   an appeal which   had been determined by court of   equal jurisdiction and was seeking   this court to sit on appeal of another Judge’s judgment.
That the period spent in custody pending the hearing and determination of his case in the subordinate court was considered   during the appeal.  That the petition had no merit. 
The issue for determination is whether the petition/application for revision has any merit. 
It is true that the petitioner did file an appeal no. 2/2019 which was heard and determined by the Hon. Justice C. Kariuki.  
 That    the court dismissed   his appeal, sustained the conviction   and the sentence and directed that the sentence to start from the date the appellant was arrested. In the circumstances - Section 333 of the Criminal Procedure Code is   not applicable to the petitioner.  
With respect to alleged   violation of   his rights -  there is no evidence    that the applicant   has given   to this court to demonstrate that any   of the rights he alleges to have been violated were violated. 
 As to whether the applicant should   serve a non-custodial    sentence the petitioner gives the reason/ground - that he is too old to waste all that time in prison – really? The petitioner is not seeing the value of his imprisonment as a consequence of a legitimate sentence - if he considers it a waste of time - then perhaps he has not appreciated the fact that he was found guilty of a sexual offence.  
 In addition, his appeal against the conviction and sentence   was dismissed, the conviction and sentence upheld by this court.",Masesi_v_Republic_(Constitutional_Petition_127 of 2022)_[2023] KEHC 25430 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)

CIVIL APPEAL NO. E762 OF 2021
MANA PAHRMACY LTD……................................. APPELLANT
-VERSUS-
SAI PHARMACEUTICALS LTD……………..........RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the ruling of Hon. D. W. Mburu (SPM) in Milimani CMCC No. E8520 OF 2021 delivered on 12/11/2021
JUDGMENT
This appeal arose out of a ruling delivered on 12/11/2021 in a notice of preliminary objection filed by the appellant on the basis that CMCC no. E8520 of 2020 was sub judice since it was a duplicity of another suit namely BUNGOMA CMCC No. 25 of 2020.
Further, that the trial court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter since the contractual place where both the appellant and respondent reside and carry on business was outside the jurisdiction of the trial court.
The trial court dismissed the notice of preliminary objection on the basis that no pleading in respect of BUNGOMA CMCC E025 of 2020 were tabled before the trial court to enable it make a determination.
The appellant has appealed to this court on the following grounds.
THAT the learned magistrate erred in law and misdirected himself when he failed to consider the applicants’ submissions on points of law and facts on jurisdiction.
THAT the learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to analyse or to give consideration to the evidence adduced by the appellant and thereby arriving at a decision which was erroneous in the circumstance.
THAT the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to find that the issues of appellant’s place of business, place of carrying on business, arose to affirm that the honourable court lacked jurisdiction and they were already admitted and not contested by the respondent in their submissions.
THAT the learned magistrate erred in fact in finding that the appellant had failed to attach pleadings from Bungoma CC No. E025 of 2020 when in fact they had attached the same to their submissions.",Mana_Pahrmacy_Ltd_v_Sai_Pharmaceuticals_Ltd_(Civil_Appeal_E762 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25396 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
276a61fc5ef4-1,"The parties filed submissions as follows: the appellant submitted that the learned magistrate erred in law and misdirected himself in paragraph 9 of the ruling by noting that the appellant had failed to provide the court with a copy of the said pleadings which was not the case. The copy of the plaint was part of the bundle of documents attached to the appellant’s duly filed submissions.
The appellant further submitted that the appellant is a non-resident defendant within the description of Section 15 of the Civil Procedure Act Cap 21 which provides
“Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction—  
 the defendant or each of the defendants (where there are more than one) at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or
any of the defendants (where there are more than one) at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided either the leave of the court is given, or the defendants who do not reside or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid acquiesce in such institution; or  
the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises”
There was no express contract between the plaintiff and defendant companies. The place where the contract was to be performed or performance thereof completed was the place of delivery of the goods which was the defendant’s principal and only place of business in Bungoma. The place where the money was expressly or impliedly payable was also the defendant’s place of business in Bungoma County. The appellant in support cited Mombasa HC CA 178 of 2016; County Government of Kakamega v Ufanisi Freighters (K) Limited Trawlers Limited [2018] eKLR allowed an appeal and agreed that the lower court had no jurisdiction in a case filed for the recovery of money for work procured on the basis that the defendant (appellant) offices were located and contract to be performed in Kakamega while the case was filed in Mombasa.  
The appellant further submitted that this suit is a mere replica and /or duplicity of Bungoma CC E025/2020 where the parties herein are directly involved and the matters herein raised are substantially in issue.",Mana_Pahrmacy_Ltd_v_Sai_Pharmaceuticals_Ltd_(Civil_Appeal_E762 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25396 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
276a61fc5ef4-2,"The respondent submitted that the learned magistrate analysed the law and considered the appellant’s counsel’s submission on point of territorial jurisdiction and doctrine of duplicity. The Magistrate observed that matters as to where cause of action arose, place where contract was made and place where parties ordinarily carry on business are matters of fact which are contestable and since they require evidence cannot conclusively determine the suit as is expected of a Preliminary Objection.
On the issue as to whether the suit is sub judice the appellant had not placed before the court any material to enable the court to make a determination as to whether the parties in Nairobi MCCC E8520 of 2021 were related to the parties, issues and subject of Bungoma CMCC E025 of 2020. The respondent submitted that sub judice rule would not apply as there is no identity of the matter in issue in both suits. 
Further that the preliminary objection fails the test for applicability of the subjudice rule because if a final decision is to be reached on Bungoma MCC E025 of 2020 such decision would not operate as res judicata in Nairobi MCCC E8520 of 2021.
The respondent argued that the Notice of Preliminary Objection is not argued on the assumption that all facts pleaded by the Plaintiff are correct. Therefore, the facts have to be ascertained and the issues cannot be conclusively be determined at a preliminary stage. That the appeal herein therefore lacks merit as the trial magistrate was correct in his finding.
The duty of the first appellate court is re-evalaute the evidence before the trial court and to arrive at its own conclusion whether to support the findings of the Trial court.
The issues for determination in this appeal are as follows;
Whether the trial court was right in dismissing the notice of preliminary objection.
Whether the appeal should be allowed.
Who pays the costs of this appeal?
On the issue as to whether the trial court was right in dismissing the notice of preliminary objection, the issues  raised in the  preliminary objection could not be conclusively be determined since no materials were placed before the court to show that the parties in Nairobi MCCC E8520 of 2021 and BUNGOMA CMCC No. 25 of 2020 were the same .
 I find that details of BUNGOMA CMCC No. 25 of 2020 have not been availed.",Mana_Pahrmacy_Ltd_v_Sai_Pharmaceuticals_Ltd_(Civil_Appeal_E762 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25396 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)

VERSUS
PATRICK QUARCOO………................................DEFENDANT
RULING
The application coming for consideration is the one dated 6/3/2023 brought under Section 1A, 1b and 3a OF THE Civil Procedure Act, Under Order 22 rule 22, Order 40, Rules 1, and 4, Order 42, Rule 6, Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, Cap 21 Laws of Kenya and all other enabling provisions of law seeking the following orders;
This application be certified urgent and service thereof be dispensed with and the same be herd ex-parte in the first instance.
Pending the hearing and determination of this application, this honourable court be pleased to grant a stay of execution of the judgment delivered by Hon. Justice Sergon on 24th February 2023 in HCCC NO. 373 of 2010 – Nairobi and any other decree that ensue therefrom.
The costs of this application be provided for.
Any other orders that the honourable court may deem fit to grant.
The application is based on the following grounds;
On 24th February 2023, the honourable court delivered judgment in favour of the plaintiff and awarded him kshs.3,300,000 in damages.
The defendant is dissatisfied with the decision and intends to appeal against it.  The defendant has filed a notice of appeal and requested for typed proceedings and a certified copy of the judgment.
The defendant has an arguable appeal which will be rendered nugatory in the event a stay of execution for the following reasons, among others:
The impugned letter of 8th June 2010 was written by the defendant in his capacity as the Chief Executive Officer of Radio Africa Limited and addressed to the plaintiff as the Corporation Secretary of Kenya Broadcasting Corporation and discussed actions taken by Kenya Broadcasting Corporation.  Companies operate through their officials and it is arguable that any defamation suit should have instead been instituted by Kenya Broadcasting Corporation against Radio Africa Limited.",Oira_v_Quarcoo_(Civil_Case_373 of 2010)_[2023] KEHC 25355 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
4e7e95871380-1,"The letter of 8th June 2020 was covered by qualified privileges as it aimed to discharge a private duty, the defendant as the Chief Executive Officer of Radio Africa Limited had a legitimate interest in the subject matter of the letter and the letter raised a complaint about a statutory body which has a public authority or responsibility.
The contents of the letter of 8th June 2020 were substantially true.
The letter of 8th June 2020 as a demand letter and there was no malice on the part of the defendant, as the Chief Executive Officer of Radio Africa Limited, in communicating their dissatisfaction with Kenya Broadcasting Corporation on how the latter had handled Memorandum of Understanding the parties had made.
When delivering the judgment, the Honourable Court granted the defendant a 30 day stay of execution pending the filing of a formal stay application.  The stay is scheduled to lapse on 26th March 2023.
The defendant stands to suffer substantial loss in the event the judgment of 24th February 2023 is not stayed, and the plaintiff is allowed to commence the execution process for kshs.3,300,000 he was awarded as damages.  The defendant is apprehensive that in the event the appeal is successful, he will be unable to recover the sums and/or will be subjected to lengthy litigious process for the recovery of the sums which will expose the defendant to further expenses.
The defendant is willing to deposit the decretal sum as security in a joint interest earning account in the names of the advocates representing the parties.
This application has been brought timeously and without unreasonable delay and it is in the interest of fairness and justice that this application is heard urgently at the court’s earliest convenience.
The plaintiff will not be prejudiced if the orders sought herein are granted.
It is in the interest of justice that this application is allowed.
The application is supported by the affidavit of the applicant PATRICK QUARCOO sworn on 6/3/2023 which reiterates the grounds on which this application is premised.",Oira_v_Quarcoo_(Civil_Case_373 of 2010)_[2023] KEHC 25355 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
4e7e95871380-2,"The respondent Hezekia Oira filed a replying affidavit sworn on 25/4/2023 opposing the application dated 6/3/2023 in which he deponed that the judgment in HCCC No. 373 of 2010 was delivered on 24/2/2023. The court found as a fact the letter written by the applicant on 8/6/2010 that disparaged the respondent was false and that the applicant was actuated by malice and because the respondent’s employer KBC dismissed and got the respondent prosecuted never mind that he was acquitted had achieved his malicious intentions
The judgement that was delivered awarded the respondent a sum of Kshs 3,000,000 general damages for defamation and Kshs 300,000 for aggravated damages making a total of total of Kshs. 3,300,000. The applicant was granted a temporary stay of execution for 30 days to pay but to date he has not done the same and has instead brought this present application seeking for stay pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal.
Apart from the speculative allegations the applicant has not given any evidence of substantial loss or any reason why he thinks that he will be unable to recover the said sum. He indicated that as an advocate of the high court he will be able to refund the decretal sum to the applicant in the event he succeeds in the appeal.
The applicant filed a supplementary affidavit sworn on 28/4/2023 in response to the replying affidavit.
The parties filed written submissions as follows; the applicant in his submission indicated that he would suffer substantial loss  and his appeal will be rendered nugatory unless the orders sought herein are granted. He contended that he has an arguable appeal that ought to be considered on its merits by the court of appeal.
The applicant further submitted that the respondent bears the burden of proving his ability to repay the decretal sum once the applicant has raised his reasonable apprehensions to the court and in support cited the case of National Industrial Credit Bank Ltd v Aquinas Francis Wasike & another [2006] eKLR the Court of Appeal considered this burden as follows:",Oira_v_Quarcoo_(Civil_Case_373 of 2010)_[2023] KEHC 25355 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)
4e7e95871380-3,"“This Court has said before and it would bear repeating that while the legal duty is on an applicant to prove the allegation that an appeal would be rendered nugatory because a respondent would be unable to pay back the decretal sum, it is unreasonable to expect such an applicant to know in detail the resources owned by the respondent or lack of them. Once an applicant expresses that a respondent would be unable to pay back the decretal sum, the evidential burden must then shift to the respondent to show what resources he has since that is a matter which is peculiarly within his knowledge.”
The applicant contended further that he has complied with the courts directions on security and urged this court to consider the holding in Focin Motorcycle Co. Limited vs. Ann Wambui Wangui & Another [2018] eKLR where it was held that
“…Where the applicant proposes to provide security as the Applicant has done, it is a mark of good faith that the application for stay is not just meant to deny the respondent the fruits of judgment.  My view is that it is sufficient for the applicant to state that he is ready to provide security or to propose the kind of security but it is the discretion of the Court to determine the security.  The Applicant has offered to provide security and has therefore satisfied this ground for stay…”
The respondent submitted that the applicant alleges that he has an arguable appeal however no memorandum of appeal was attached to the application to ascertain whether the applicant has a good appeal with a chance of success. The applicant has also not assigned any error in the learned judge’s finding or any evidence to justify his perception. 
The respondent argued that the applicant’s apprehension that he would be unable to refund the decretal sum cannot be a ground of granting of stay of execution. Moreover, this court and the court of appeal has held severally that in a money judgement the applicant must demonstrate with evidence that the respondent will not be able to refund the money and also by evidence the damages he will suffer unless the order is granted.
The issues for determination in this application are as follows;
Whether the application was filed without undue delay.
Whether the applicant is entitled to stay pending appeal.
I find that the application was filed on 6/3/2023 one month after the judgment was delivered on 24/2/2023.
I also find that the applicant has deposited security for the due performance of the decree.",Oira_v_Quarcoo_(Civil_Case_373 of 2010)_[2023] KEHC 25355 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Ruling)

In the case of Patrick Ngetakimanzi vs Marcus Mutuamuluvi & 2 Others- High Court Election Petition No. 8 of 2013 it was held as follows;
“Security of costs ensures that the respondent is not left without recompense for any costs or charges payable to him. The duty of the court is therefore to create a level ground for all the parties involved, in this case, the proportionality of the right of the petitioner to access to justice vis-a-vis the respondent's right to have security for any costs that may be owed to him and not to have vexatious proceedings brought against him.”

THAT stay of execution of the judgment delivered on 24/2/2023 be and is hereby granted pending appeal to the Court of Appeal.

(Being an appeal from the judgement of the Magistrate’s court at Webuye in SRMCC No. 186 of 2005 by Hon. C.N Oruo (Rm) delivered on 25th April, 2016)
JUDGEMENT
The appellant was the defendant before the subordinate court after the 1st and 2nd respondents filed a suit against him seeking the recovery of Kshs 158,000/- plus interest at 25% from 2003 to date of filing suit as well as costs of the suit. The 1st and 2nd respondents had sold the appellant six parcels of land comprised in land parcel no. Ndivisi/Mihuu/211 at the price of Kshs 360,000/-. They alleged that the appellant paid a total of Kshs 202,000/- leaving a balance of Kshs 158,000/-.
The appellant in his statement of defence averred that he had paid the full consideration as the balance of Kshs 158,000/- was deposited with the advocates for the 1st and 2nd respondents.
The 3rd respondent who was admitted as the third party filed its statement of defence and disputed that the amount of Kshs 158,000/- was owing. According to the 3rd respondent, the correct amount owing to the 2nd respondent was Kshs 145,000/- on the grounds that he received Kshs 20,000/- from the 3rd respondent.
After an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate entered judgment in favour of the 1st and 2nd respondents against the appellant for Kshs 158,000/- being the outstanding balance of the purchase price plus interest at 14%.
The appellant is aggrieved by the finding of the subordinate court and thus challenged the same on the following grounds:",Sekapchanga_v_Mulongo_&_2_others_(Civil_Appeal_22 of 2016)_[2023] KEHC 25419 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
f6b9652e729d-1,"That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in allowing the 1st and 2nd respondent’s claim when the same had not been proved on a balance of probability as required by law.
That the learned trial magistrate erred both in law and in fact in holding that interest be calculated at the rate of 14% from the date of default contrary to the evidence on record.
That the learned trial magistrate erred both in law and in fact in holding that any payments made by the appellant to the 3rd respondent were meant for other purposes when it was clear from the evidence on record that the appellant’s evidence was not challenged by the 3rd respondent who chose not to offer any evidence.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by failing to consider and analyse the evidence of the appellant against the 3rd respondent.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact when it held that the 3rd respondent did not file any pleadings when it was clear from the record that the 3rd respondent filed his statement of defence in court on 19th April 2006.
The learned trial magistrate did not fairly analyse the evidence of the appellant vis-à-vis the testimony of the 2nd respondent.
The learned trial magistrate misapprehended the entire claim of the appellant against the 3rd respondent.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. The appellant filed his submissions on 21/8/2023 while the respondents have not filed any submissions as at the time of writing this judgement.
The appellant in his submissions argues that there existed no advocate-client relationship between the appellant and the 3rd respondent. The appellant denied that it instructed the 3rd respondent to act for him in any case and asserted that the money sent to them was to be transmitted to the 1st and 2nd respondents. The 3rd respondent did not provide any evidence to account for the money they claimed were fees for legal services.  The appellant contends that the 3rd party did not prove its case as required under section 107 of the Evidence Act. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to consider the evidence that was produced by the appellant which showed the 3rd respondent received money on behalf of his clients and that he failed to establish that there existed no advocate-client relationship between the said parties.",Sekapchanga_v_Mulongo_&_2_others_(Civil_Appeal_22 of 2016)_[2023] KEHC 25419 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
f6b9652e729d-2,"They also advanced that the appellant was clear in his evidence that he paid all the balance of the purchase price to the 3rd respondent who was to remit the same to the 1st and 2nd respondents. The 1st and 2nd respondents admitted in their plaint that they were aware that the appellant deposited the purchase price and that the appellant tendered evidence showing that he deposited the money with the 3rd respondent. There was no evidence by the 3rd respondent to show that they had received instructions from the appellant.
Analysis and determination
As a first appellate court, this court’s role is to subject the whole of the evidence to a fresh and exhaustive scrutiny and make its own conclusions about it, bearing in mind that it did not have the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses first-hand. This duty was well stated in Selle & Another v Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd. & Others (1968) EA 123 in the following terms:
“I accept counsel for the respondent’s proposition that this court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate the evidence or if the impression based on the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally (Abdul Hammed Saif v Ali Mohamed Sholan (1955), 22 E.A.C.A. 270).",Sekapchanga_v_Mulongo_&_2_others_(Civil_Appeal_22 of 2016)_[2023] KEHC 25419 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
f6b9652e729d-3,"Emmanuel Situma Sikanga (Pw1) testified that he sold to the appellant 6 acres of land for Kshs 360,000/- and was paid Kshs 195,000/-. He was later paid Kshs. 7,000/- but he is yet to receive the balance of Kshs 158,000/-. He testified that he is yet to receive money from the 3rd defendant. On cross-examination, he testified that on 22/2/2003 he was given money by the appellant in the presence of the 3rd respondent. He could not tell what the Kshs 53,000/- paid by the appellant to the 3rd defendant was for and he neither knew what the Kshs 249,000/- was for.  
Kingsley Mutali Sekapchanga (Dw1) testified that he entered into an agreement with the 1st and 2nd respondents for the purchase of 6 acres of land and upon execution Kshs 195,000/- was paid. He deposited money to the 3rd respondent as part payment, on 17/2/2003. The 3rd respondent was acting for the 1st and 2nd respondents and that the title of the land was being held as surety in court. Dw1 later made two deposits of Kshs 25,400/- on 27/2/2003 and later on Kshs 298,000/-. Kshs 90,000/- was paid to Mary Naliaka, a sister to the 1st and 2nd respondent. Dw1 testified that he deposited money to the 3rd respondent’s account which monies were to be remitted to the 2nd respondent. On cross-examination, he testified that he had a client-advocate relationship with the 3rd respondent. He maintained that he paid professional fees but did not have proof of payment.
I have considered the submissions and the evidence on record. It is not in dispute that the 1st and 2nd respondents were paid Kshs 195,000/- upon execution of the contract and further Kshs 7,000/- on 2/1/2005. The only dispute relates to the payment of the balance of the purchase price being Kshs. 158,000/-.",Sekapchanga_v_Mulongo_&_2_others_(Civil_Appeal_22 of 2016)_[2023] KEHC 25419 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
f6b9652e729d-4,"There was no evidence that the balance of Kshs 158,000/- was paid to the 1st and 2nd respondents. The appellant testified that he deposited money with the 3rd respondent for onward transmission of the same to the 1st and 2nd respondents. 
The 3rd respondent acted for the appellant, 1st and 2nd respondent. Pw1 testified that the title to the land was in the custody of the court and was released after the appellant and the 3rd respondent posted cash bail. Dexh1 revealed that the appellant paid Kshs 53,000/- through the 3rd respondent on 17/2/2003.   Dw1 also testified that there existed a client-advocate relationship with the 3rd respondent. At the time of execution of the sale agreement, the appellant had paid Kshs 195,000/- leaving a balance of Kshs 165,000/-.
Dw1 produced Dexh 1, 2 and 3 all showing that he deposited money with the 3rd respondent. Immediately after the parties signed the agreement, the appellant deposited Kshs 25,400 on 27/2/2003 into the 3rd respondent’s account and later on 5/03/2003, he further deposited Kshs 248,000/-. He explained that Kshs 25,000/- was for the survey costs. This therefore left the 3rd respondent with a balance of Kshs 248,000/- and according to Dw1, the 3rd respondent was to remit the balance of the purchase price to the 1st and 2nd respondents.",Sekapchanga_v_Mulongo_&_2_others_(Civil_Appeal_22 of 2016)_[2023] KEHC 25419 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
f6b9652e729d-5,"The 3rd respondent filed its statement of defence but did not present any evidence to challenge the evidence of the appellant. The evidence of the appellant therefore remained uncontroverted. After a comprehensive examination of the evidence, I find that the 3rd respondent (third party) failed to transfer the funds that the appellant had deposited into its account to the 1st and 2nd respondent. In my view, the sole responsibility for settling the remaining balance of the purchase price, amounting to Kshs 158,000/-, should rest squarely on the shoulders of the 3rd respondent who was the advocate for the vendors. In any case, the 3rd Respondent (Third Party) confirmed in its statement of defence and evidence that it had acted for the vendors in the transaction.   As the appellant had successfully enjoined the law firm as a third party and having proved that he duly deposited the sums in question with the third party, it was thus erroneous for the learned trial magistrate to hold that the sums had been paid in respect of legal fees. Consequently, I find the decision arrived at was erroneous and must be interfered with.
In the result, I find merit in the appeal. The same is allowed. The judgement of the trial court dated 25/4/2016 is hereby set aside and in its place, judgment is entered for 1st and 2nd respondents against the 3rd respondent (third party) in the sum of Kshs 158,000/-at 14%P.a from the date of default. The appellant shall have costs of the appeal as against the 3rd respondent while the 1st and 2nd Respondents will have costs in the lower court to be borne by the 3rd Respondent (Third Party).

(Being an appeal from the Ruling and Order of Hon. K.O. Gweno, RM/Adjudicator dated 20th September 2021 at the Small Claims Court at Nairobi SCC No. No.40 of 2021)
JUDGMENT
The parties are currently embroiled in proceedings before the Small Claims Court where the Respondent claims to have supplied 345 laptops worth Kshs. 7,762,000.00 to the Appellant for which it paid leaving a balance of Kshs. 762,500.00 which the Respondent seeks. On 20.09.2021, after the close of hearing of the parties’ cases, the Respondent’s counsel orally sought leave of the court to file additional documents. The Appellant’s counsel opposed the application on the ground that both parties had closed their cases and that the Respondent had time to prepare its case and that the Respondent’s counsel ought to have sought for an adjournment. In response, the Respondent’s counsel averred that he was in fact seeking “leave to file a substantive application” and that the Appellant would not be prejudiced with the application since they had the Respondent’s documents.",La_Salle_Catholic_Primary_School_v_Eagle_Group_International_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E793 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25358 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
eea7855f528f-1,"By a ruling dated 20.09.2021 (“the Ruling”), the Adjudicator held that the Appellant had not explained how it would be prejudiced if the court allowed the application for additional evidence to be adduced. He noted that the application made was based on the court’s discretion and that the said discretion had to be exercised judiciously. Further, that Article 159(2) of the Constitution enjoined the court dispense substantive justice without undue regard to technicalities and that in this case, the subordinate court had to determine the real issue in controversy. That if the additional evidence would assist the court in arriving at an accurate decision, then it ought to be allowed. The Adjudicator further held that the Appellant would also cross-examine the witness on the said additional documents and in that regard, it made orders re-opening the suit, directing the Appellant to be supplied with the additional documents so that it can defend itself and that the parties were at liberty to call witnesses for purposes of producing the said additional documents and cross-examination.
The Appellant is dissatisfied with the Ruling and appeals to this court based on the amended memorandum of appeal dated 13.07.2022. The appeal has been canvassed by way written submissions. 
In its submissions, the Appellant raises the following issues for determination. First, whether the Smalls Claims Court can order re-opening of a matter once both parties have closed their case. If so, under what circumstances. It also asks whether the court should be moved by a formal application and whether both parties must substantially be heard before the court can make a finding. 
The Small Claims Court Act, 2016 (“the SCCA”) and the Small Claims Court Rules, 2019 (“the Rules”) are silent on whether the Small Claims Court has the power to order for re-opening of a case once both parties have testified and closed their respective cases. The parties agree that the decision on whether or not to allow a party to re-open its case and to adduce additional evidence is a matter of discretion. In this respect the court is guided by the principles set out at section 3 of the SCCA that is; timely disposal of all proceeding using the least expensive method, equal opportunity to access judicial services, fairness of process and simplicity of procedure.",La_Salle_Catholic_Primary_School_v_Eagle_Group_International_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E793 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25358 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
eea7855f528f-2,"Further, under section 17 of the SCCA, the court is empowered to control its own procedure in determination of claims before it and in exercise of that control, the court shall have regard to the rules of natural justice. This provision is echoed by the Rules which at Rule 31 provides that in conduct of proceedings the Court shall not be bound by the strict rules of procedure and evidence. 
The totality of the provisions I have cited means that the High Court in exercising appellate jurisdiction must be alive to the general objective of the Small Claims Court and avoid being too prescriptive in its decisions to the extent of undermining the essence of the Small Claims Court.
This appeal concerns the exercise of discretion by the Adjudicator. This court is guided by the principle settled in Mbogo v Shah [1968] EA 93 that an appellate court will not interfere with the decision of the trial court unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his discretion has misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision, or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been an injustice. Thus, when Adjudicator considers an application to reopen a case and for leave to adduce additional evidence, it must act judiciously by allowing and granting the parties an opportunity to make their case to the fullest extent bearing in mind the principles articulated in the SCCA and underpinned by Article 159(2)(d) of the Constitution which commands the court to eschew procedural technicalities.",La_Salle_Catholic_Primary_School_v_Eagle_Group_International_Limited_(Civil_Appeal_E793 of 2021)_[2023] KEHC 25358 (KLR)_(Civ)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
eea7855f528f-3,"Having read the record, I hold the Adjudicator erred in failing to grant the Respondent an opportunity to make its case. The Respondent requested for an opportunity to make a formal application. While I accept that oral and informal applications are allowed, a formal application allows a party to put its case fully before the court and permits the other party to respond. The Respondent sought the leave of the court to file a substantive application which I believe would have included the information/documents sought to be adduced and would have assisted the court determine their relevance. The court would thus be in a better position to make a judicious decision as to whether to reopen the case and admit the additional evidence. Rendering the Ruling without allowing the substantive application to be filed first also denied the Appellant the opportunity to substantively reply to the said application thereby occasioning it prejudice. In addition, the court did not interrogate why the said additional evidence was not called earlier on at the hearing as such an interrogation was necessary and relevant at that stage to once again inform the trial court’s discretion. Failure to interrogate this and proceeding to make the Ruling was a misapprehension and abuse of the trial court’s discretion.
I also do not think that the constrained timeline of the Small Claims Court is an impediment to the Adjudicator permitting a formal application since the court and parties are aware of timelines embedded in the SCCA and the Adjudicator is empowered to give appropriate directions. 
For the reasons I have given, I allow the appeal. I remand the matter to the Small Claims Court to give direction on the Respondent’s request to file a formal application bearing in mind the considerations I have made and in particular the timelines. 
Given the nature of the appeal, each party shall bear its own costs.

Before Court is the application dated 16/3/2023. The same was brought under sections 1A, 1B & 3A of the Civil Procedure Act, section 7 of the appellate jurisdiction Act, Order 50 rules 1 and 6 of the Civil Procedure rules.  
The application sought for the extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal against the judgment of this Court delivered on 30/9/2022. That the notice of appeal already filed be deemed to be as duly filed.
In support of the application, the applicant relied on the grounds on the face of it and on the supporting affidavit of James K Muthui sworn on 16/3/2023. It was the applicant’s contention that the Court dismissed its case on 30/9/2022 and it intended to appeal against that decision.",Indigo_Telcom_Limited_v_Independent_Electoral_and_Boundaries_Commission_&_5_others_(Commercial_Case_391 of 2015)_[2023] KEHC 25423 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
49b01ceb9aec-1,"In explaining the delay, it was averred that the advocate who had the conduct of the matter had not filed the notice of appeal although she had informed the applicant’s counsel that the same had been filed together with the request for proceedings. That upon discovery of the failure to file, the applicant filed the notice of appeal on 14/3/2023 without further delay. It was averred that the appeal was arguable and the applicant would suffer great injustice if the orders sought are not granted. That the delay was not intended and was not inordinate and the error of the advocate should not be visited on the client.
The 1st defendant opposed the application vide a replying affidavit of Chrispine Owiye sworn on 19/4/2023. It was averred that the plaintiff had not served the 1st defendant on time as required by Rule 75(2) of the Court of Appeal Rules. That no good or sufficient cause was provided to explain the delay in filing the notice of appeal. It was contended that the delay of 6 months was inordinate and that the draft memorandum of appeal annexed to the application did not disclose an arguable appeal. The application was termed as incompetent and an abuse to the court process.
On their part, the 2nd to 5th defendant filed a response to the application via a replying affidavit sworn on 10/5/2023 by EDWIN M MUKELE. He averred that the defendants were served with the notice of appeal on 20/3/2023, 6 months after the judgment was delivered. 
According to him, there had been no sufficient cause for failing to serve the notice within the stipulated timelines. That 6months delay was inordinate and inexcusable and the defendants would suffer great prejudice if the orders sought are granted.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions which have been considered.
The applicant submitted that it was deserving of the orders sought as the delay in filing the notice of appeal was caused by an error of the part of the Counsel who had the conduct of the matter. That upon discovery of the error, the applicant’s advocates had acted promptly without any further delay and the interest of justice would dictate granting the orders sought.",Indigo_Telcom_Limited_v_Independent_Electoral_and_Boundaries_Commission_&_5_others_(Commercial_Case_391 of 2015)_[2023] KEHC 25423 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
49b01ceb9aec-2,"It was further submitted that the delay was not inordinate or intentional as it was caused by error of Counsel. That the appeal raised matters of general public importance and the applicants would not suffer any prejudice that cannot not be compensated by costs.
It was submitted for the respondents that the applicant had not provided any good or sufficient reason for the delay as the applicant ought to have been keen and diligent in following up on its case. That the mere allegation that the mistake was on the part of Counsel was not sufficient enough to invoke the court’s jurisdiction. 
That the delay of five months was inordinate and appeal cannot be said to be of public importance since it involved a private contractual arrangement between the applicant and the 1st defendant.
I have considered the parties’ contestations and the submissions on record. The applicant seeks leave to have the notice of appeal admitted out of time. 
Rule 75 of the Court of Appeal Rules provides: - 
“1.■Any person who desires to appeal to the Court shall give notice in writing, which shall be lodged in duplicate with the registrar of the superior court.
2.■Every such notice shall, subject to rules 84 and 97, be so lodged within fourteen days of the date of the decision against which it is desired to appeal.”
It is not in dispute that judgment in this matter was delivered on 30/9/2022. The notice of appeal was filed on 14/3/2023, nearly six month’s later. 
In Thuita Mwangi v Kenya  Airways [2003] eKLR, the Court of Appeal reiterated its decision in Mutiso v Mwangi  [1997] KLR 630 as follows: -
“It is now well settled that the decision whether or not to extend the time for appealing is essentially discretionary.  It is also well settled that generally the matters which this court takes into account in deciding whether to grant an extension of time are; first, the length of delay; secondly, the reason for the delay; thirdly (possibly) the chances of appeal succeeding if the application is granted; and fourthly, the degree of prejudice to the Respondent of the application is granted.”",Indigo_Telcom_Limited_v_Independent_Electoral_and_Boundaries_Commission_&_5_others_(Commercial_Case_391 of 2015)_[2023] KEHC 25423 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
49b01ceb9aec-3,"The principles applicable in an application for leave out of time were also considered by the Supreme Court in Nicholas Kiptoo Korir Arap Salat Vs.  IEBC and 7 Others [2014] eKLR as follows: -
“The underlying principles a court should consider in exercise of such discretion include;
1.■Extension of time is not a right of any party.  It is an equitable remedy that is only available to a deserving party at the discretion of the court;
2.■A party who seeks for extension of time has the burden of laying a basis to the satisfaction of the court;
3.■Whether the court should exercise the discretion to extend time, is a consideration to be made a case- to-case basis;
4.■Whether there is a reasonable reason for the delay. The   delay   should be explained to the satisfaction of the court;
5.■Whether there will be any prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted;
6.■Whether the application has been brought without undue delay.
7. ...”
From the foregoing, the Court will have to apply the said principles in determining the present application. These are; the duration of the delay, the reason for the delay, the prejudice that would be occasioned to the respondents and merit of the appeal. 
In the present case, since the judgment was delivered on 30/9/2022, the notice of appeal ought to have been filed by the 14/10/2022. The notice of appeal was however filed on 14/3/2023, meaning a delay of over 5 months. Even if we were to take into consideration the excluded period, under Order 50 rule 4 of between 21/12/2022 and 13/1/2023, in the computation of time, the delay will still be in excess of 4 months. That in my view was in ordinate delay. The same requires an explanation.
In explaining the delay, it was explained that it was the advocate who was conducting the matter who failed to take steps to lodge the appeal. The law firm representing the applicant admitted that the default was attributable to it. It was the applicant’s contention is that the default of its advocates should not be visited upon it.",Indigo_Telcom_Limited_v_Independent_Electoral_and_Boundaries_Commission_&_5_others_(Commercial_Case_391 of 2015)_[2023] KEHC 25423 (KLR)_(Commercial_and_Tax)_(20 November 2023)_(Ruling)
49b01ceb9aec-4,"The respondents opposed the application on the ground that the delay was inordinate and the reasons advanced by the applicant are not sufficient.
I am of the view that, it is not uncommon that advocates in law firms are susceptible to making grave mistakes. They may fail to report the proper steps taken in a litigation. The question this Court has to answer is, should it let the client pursue an action for professional negligence in those circumstances? My view is that the Court should be very restrained from taking that route. That route should be taken only when it is clear that the delay is so inordinate and to allow an extension it would extremely prejudice the opposite party.
In the present case, the delay was inordinate delay. However, there was no evidence on the part of the respondents that they would be exposed to prejudice that cannot be compensated by an award of costs if the extension sought was granted. 
In the interests of justice, this matter raises very important issues of public interest. What happens where a public entity decides to take a shortcut in favour of a preferred private investor to the exclusion of others? Should the law be applied strictly to prevent the private sector players from enticing public officers and/or entities from engaging in wrongful, irregular and acts that amount to an illegality? These are issues in my view that require to be examined, interrogated on and pronounced in a resounding manner by our esteemed Appellate Court.  
Accordingly, I am inclined to allow the application to give that esteemed Court an opportunity to interrogate the matter. I cannot in my position examine whether or not the intended appeal is arguable having in mind that I am convinced that I was right in my judgment. Talking for myself, the appeal is unarguable. However, that is the role and preserve of the Court of Appeal.
Accordingly, the Court finds merit in the application and hereby allows the same as prayed. However, the applicant shall bear the costs of the application.
It is so ordered.

The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs.",Erastus_v_Zhongmei_Engineering_Group_Limited_&_another;_Attorney_General_(Interested_Party)_(Cause_2449 of 2017)_[2023] KEELRC 2946 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
71db2edce00c-1,"The claimant’s case was that through a letter dated 30.08.2017, the 2nd respondent being a consultant for a project known as the Western Transmission (Kabete-Uthiru-Karen) Pipeline Lot 2, directed the 1st respondent to employ the claimant, in the twin capacity of site surveyor and technician with effect from 25.08.2017  for a period of twenty months, in accordance with a clause 706 of particulars specifications and item no 3.12 of Bill no. 1 (Preliminaries and General). 
It is the claimant’s case that the 1st respondent disregarded the terms of the subject contract of employment, and put him on half salary until 31.10.2017 when the 2nd respondent’s project manager verbally terminated his employment without lawful cause. 
On the part of the 1st and 2nd respondent it was pleaded that there was a contract between the parties as the claimant was issued with the letter of appointment. The respondents denied that the monthly salary and allowances was Kshs.155,000 as alleged for the claimant. Further, the appointment letter issued to the claimant captured what was verbally agreed between the parties to the tune of Kshs.40,000/= being monthly gross emoluments which amount was accepted by the claimant because it was based on the nature of work to be assigned to him. Further, the respondents admitted receiving that demand letter but did not act on it because it was without basis. They denied the claims and prayers in the amended statement of claim.
The Claimant filed testified to support his case but despite numerous opportunities to call the witness to testify, the respondent failed to do so. The respondent as well failed to file the final submissions.  The Court has considered all the material on record and returns as follows.",Erastus_v_Zhongmei_Engineering_Group_Limited_&_another;_Attorney_General_(Interested_Party)_(Cause_2449 of 2017)_[2023] KEELRC 2946 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
71db2edce00c-2,"To answer the 1st issue the Court returns that parties were in a contract of service. The claimant was employed by the letter dated 30.08.2017 to work for the Resident Engineer in the project as pleaded for the claimant. The letter shows he was identified by the second respondent for the 1st respondent to be paid Kshs.40,000.00 gross monthly payment less statutory deduction. The employment had taken effect on 25.08.2017. The Court returns that the 1st and 2nd respondents were the joint claimant’s employers.
To answer the 2nd issue and per the claimant’s testimony, his employment was terminated at the end of October 2017. Thus, he worked for the respondents for two months. It was a verbal termination.
The 3rd issue is whether the claimant is entitled to the remedies as prayed for. The Court returns as follows:
The claimant prayed for payment of the claimant’s anticipated salary (to be specified later) and house allowance for 18 months Kshs.47,500 x 18 months =Kshs.855,000.00. The prayer is found speculative and without contractual basis. Parties appear to have agreed upon a gross or consulted monthly payment of Kshs.40,000.00. The claimant has not shown basis of the 18 months and base of monthly house allowance. The prayer will collapse. 
The claimant prayed for payment of the claimant’s unpaid salary for the entire period of his contract of employment (to be specified later) Kshs.107, 500.00 x 20 months =Kshs.2,150,000.00. At the hearing the claimant testified that  he was working for a construction company as an assistant project manager. He did not show how the termination by the respondents or other reason attributable to the respondents had diminished his capacity to thereafter engage gainfully. His evidence was that he had moved on and he was gainfully employed. He did not explain the basis for the 20 years and the Kshs.107,500.00 per month as was pleaded. The prayer will fail",Erastus_v_Zhongmei_Engineering_Group_Limited_&_another;_Attorney_General_(Interested_Party)_(Cause_2449 of 2017)_[2023] KEELRC 2946 (KLR)_(17 November 2023)_(Judgment)
71db2edce00c-3,"He prayed for leave pay which was not quantified. The Court finds that he had worked for only 2 months and had not earned leave per section 28 of the Employment Act as he had not worked for an aggregate period of 12 months.
The Court has considered the prayer for general damages for wrongful termination of employment. The termination was without notice and it appears no reason was given. It appears that in view of the service of two months and the factors in section 49 of the Act for award of compensation, one-month payment particularly in lieu of termination notice as envisaged in section 35 of the Act will meet the ends of justice making Kshs.40,000.00. 
No justification was shown for an order directing the Honourable Attorney General or the Cabinet Secretary in charge of labour relations to enforce. The same will be declined.
The claimant has substantially succeeded and is awarded costs of the suit.
In conclusion judgment is hereby entered for the claimant against the 1st and 2nd respondents jointly and severally for:
Payment of Kshs.40,000.00 less PAYE by 31.12.2023 failing interest be payable thereon from the date of this judgment till full payment.
The payment of costs of the suit.
Signed, dated and delivered by video-link and in court at Nairobi this Friday 17th November, 2023.
