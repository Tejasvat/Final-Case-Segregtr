JUDGMENT
Introduction and Background
Both parties appeal against the judgment of the Small Claims Court dated 06.02.2023 which allowed the Appellant’s claim and entered judgment in his favour for the following:
Pre-accident value – Kshs. 455,000.00
Assessment report charges – Kshs. 5,000.00
Towing expenses – Kshs. 6,000.00
Alternative transportation expenses – Kshs.75.000.00
Storage Costs – Kshs. 15,000.00
Total Kshs. 556,000.00
Costs of the claim 
Interest from the date of filing until paid in full 
The facts giving rise to the claim were largely common cause. On 30.05.2022, the Appellant took out a comprehensive insurance policy cover with the Respondent (“the policy”) for his motor vehicle registration number K** **6Q (“the motor vehicle”). The policy was to run for a period between 30.05.2022 and 29.05.2023 and was for an insured assessed value of Kshs. 750,000.00.",court,53.26%,model
"In a Statement of Claim dated 28.10.2022, the Appellant stated that on 10.06.2022, the motor vehicle was involved in a road traffic accident along Muranga-Thika Road resulting in extensive damages to the motor vehicle. The scene of the accident was attended to by a police officer who supervised the towing of the motor vehicle to Pangani Police Station where the Appellant duly reported the accident. 
The Appellant proceeded to notify the Respondent of the accident as required by the policy. He supplied all the supporting documents to enable the Respondent process his claim. While the Respondent was processing the claim, the Appellant learnt that it had instructed insurance investigators and loss assessors to investigate, assess and authenticate the claim. He co-operated with the investigators in establishing the circumstances of the accident. 
The Appellant averred that upon conclusion of the investigations, the Respondent declined to settle the claim citing “vague, unsubstantiated and concocted reasons”. The Appellant accused it of breach of the policy contract and thus claimed the repair costs, towing expenses, assessment report costs, alternate transport expenses and garage storage costs totaling Kshs. 803,740.00.
The Respondent filed its defence and urged the court to dismiss the claim. It stated that the policy was subject to strict adherence of the express and/or implied terms by the Appellant and any indemnity if any was subject to the terms and conditions of the policy. It averred that it could not be faulted for conducting its due diligence in investigating the claim and that the Appellant was kept informed throughout the investigations.
The Respondent stated that its investigator in its report dated 12.08.2022 concluded that the Appellant’s submission that the accident was reportedly caused by a distraction of an unknown pedestrian was unsubstantiated and not captured in the police records. That the damage incurred on the motor vehicle compared with the scene’s features were inconsistent with the circumstances of the accident as narrated by the Appellant, that prior to the policy’s commencement, there was a botched attempt by the Appellant to cover the motor vehicle with General Accident Insurance as evident in the Appellant’s call records and that the motor vehicle was brought to the accident scene already damaged.",court,53.04%,model
"The Respondent stated that it was an express term in the policy that the Appellant would lose any rights under the policy if it is found that the Appellant made a fraudulent claim or that the Appellant or any person acting on the Respondent’s behalf misrepresented facts or information relating to a claim. That the Respondent informed the Appellant that he had misrepresented material information when reporting the claim and the Respondent admitted that it indeed declined the claim through its letter of 23.08.2022. Thus, the Respondent asserted that it declined to admit the Appellant’s claim on grounds that the Appellant misrepresented and/or concealed material facts when reporting the claim which was a clear breach of the principle of utmost good faith and breach of the policy. 
The parties agreed to proceed and dispose of the matter by way of documents and written submissions. The Adjudicator rendered a judgment on 06.02.2023. She identified two issues for determination; whether the Respondent was justified in declining the claim and whether the Appellant was entitled to the reliefs sought. On the first issue, the Adjudicator found that the Respondent did not go beyond setting out its suspicion and failed to provide and alternative set of facts and stopped at only stating that the accident did not happen in the manner narrated by the Appellant. That the Respondent neither claimed nor proved any material non-disclosure on the Appellant’s part before the conclusion of the policy contract. The Adjudicator therefore concluded that the Respondent’s defence was a mere denial and that there was no justification to decline the claim and as such, the Respondent was in breach of the policy.",court,54.27%,model
"On the reliefs sought by the Appellant, the Adjudicator considered the assessment reports filed by both parties and concluded that it would not make any economic sense to repair the vehicle hence the Appellant was entitled to the pre-accident value of the motor vehicle less the salvage value. The Adjudicator arrived at a figure of Kshs, 655,000.00 as the pre-accident value based on the different pre-accident values of Kshs. 725,000.00 and Kshs. 585,000.00. As for the salvage value, the Adjudicator noted that there was no such indication in the report prepared by the Respondent and it thus went with the salvage value prepared by the Nordics Assessors which placed it at Kshs. 200,000.00. The court awarded Kshs. 455,000.00 under this head after reducing the pre-accident value of Kshs. 655,000.00 by the salvage value of Kshs. 200,000.00. 
The Adjudicator held that the Appellant had proved the assessment and towing charges amounting to Kshs. 5,000.00 and Kshs. 6,000.00 respectively. The Adjudicator declined the full claim for the cost of alternative transportation which was in the nature of loss of user on the ground that the claim was not reasonable and the Appellant had a duty to mitigate his loss. Further, that it was not probable that the Appellant used a cab every day to work for a total of 74 days noting that advocates do not work every day of the week. Thus, the court awarded Kshs, 75,000,00 transportation costs based on 30 days at a rate of Kshs. 2,500.00 per day. The court applied this reasoning to award Kshs. 15,000.00 storage costs for 30 days at a rate of Kshs. 500.00. 
It is for the above reasons that the Subordinate Court entered judgment for the amount set out in Para.1 above. This is the decision that triggered the appeals by both parties. The parties filed written submission in support of the positions in the consolidated appeals. 
Analysis and Determination",court,53.03%,model
"Analysis and Determination  
The court’s jurisdiction in dealing with appeals from the Small Claims Court is limited by section 38(1) of the Small Claims Court Act, 2016 which provides that ‘A person aggrieved by the decision or an order of the Court may appeal against that decision or order to the High Court on matters of law.’A court limited to matters of law is not permitted to substitute the subordinate court’s decision with its own conclusions based on its own analysis and appreciation of the facts unless the findings are so perverse that no reasonable tribunal would have arrived at them (John Munuve Mati v Returning Officer Mwingi North Constituency & 2 others [2018] eKLR).
The Respondent appeals against the entire judgment while the Appellant appeals against the damages awarded as he claimed to have specifically pleaded and proved each claim; all the cost of repairs, towing expenses, alternative transportation expenses and garage storage charges. All in all, the parties are inviting the court to interrogate whether the Subordinate Court’s findings are perverse and whether any reasonable court directing itself on the matter would have arrived at the same decision as the Adjudicator. 
The Respondent’s case is that it proved that Appellant had misrepresented and/or concealed material facts when reporting the claim which was a clear breach of the principle of utmost good faith and breach of the policy. It is common ground that the Respondent arrived at this decision based on the report dated 12.08.2022 from its investigators, Parity Loss Assessors & Consultants Limited. As stated, the parties agreed to dispose of the matter by way of documents, thus it was not expected that the author of the report would testify as to how they arrived at the said conclusions. All the Adjudicator could do, was to weigh the pleadings and documents on record and make a determination based on which of them held more sway than the other.",court,54.84%,model
"The Respondent relied on the said investigator’s report dated 12.08.2022 while the Appellant supported its case with 13 documents including a copy of the motor vehicle’s logbook, the policy document and schedule, Mpesa excerpts showing payment of the premium, the police abstract, the motor vehicle’s accident report and claim intimation form, the disclaimer letter dated 23.08.2022 from the Respondent, assessment reports from Leone Motor Assessors and Nordics Auto Assessors, receipts, car hire agreement from Toffy Touch Investment, Letter from Murgweng Enterprises Garage dated 12.08.2022 and the demand letter before action dated 18.10.2022. 
Based on the material before the court, I agree with the Adjudicator that there was little or no dispute by the Respondent that the accident indeed happened and if at all there was such a dispute, the police abstract confirmed the accident. Even the Respondent’s investigator did not dispute the occurrence of the accident. What the Respondent seemed to be disputing was how the accident occurred and the damage sustained by the motor vehicle. 
The totality of the evidence supported the conclusions of the Adjudicator that the Respondent’s case was based on suspicion, conjecture and subjective opinions of the investigators rather than facts showing how the accident occurred and the damage on the motor vehicle, were inconsistent with the Appellant’s version of events. On the part of the Appellant, his statements to the Respondent and investigators was consistent with the available evidence including the photographs attached to the Assessment reports which corroborate the Appellant’s claim that the motor vehicle sustained damages as a result of the accident. I find and hold that the Adjudicator did not err in concluding that the Respondent had failed to prove its case.",court,53.12%,model
"As regards the Appellant’s case, the Adjudicator cited Virani t/a Kisumu Beach Resort v Phoenix of East Africa Assurance Company Ltd [2004] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held that a claim for special damages should not only be pleaded but strictly proved. The Appellant claimed assessed repair costs of the motor vehicle of Kshs. 523,740.00, towing expenses of Kshs. 22,000.00, assessment report costs of Kshs. 5,000.00, alternative transport expenses of Kshs. 185,000.00 and garage storage charges of Kshs. 68,000.00. The Appellant was thus required to demonstrate that he incurred these expenses by adducing evidence proving that he made payments for the same. On the assessed repair costs, the Appellant relied on the assessment given in the report by Nordics Auto Assessors which gave repair estimates of Kshs. 523,740.00. There was nothing to show that the motor vehicle was repaired or that the Appellant expended this sum as repair costs. It is a well settled principle of law that an invoice is not proof of payment and that special damages can only be proved by producing actual receipts or invoices endorsed with the word “Paid” (see Total (Kenya) Limited Formally Caltex Oil (Kenya) Limited v Janevams Limited [2015] eKLR and Guardian Coach Ltd & another v Kiptoo (Civil Appeal 34 of 2020) [2022] KEHC 12397 (KLR) (26 May 2022) (Judgment)). This claim was therefore not proved and I find that the learned Adjudicator erred in awarding this sum based on assessed estimated costs rather than actual receipts or other evidence as proof of payment for any such repair costs. The Respondent’s appeal therefore succeeds on this ground.",court,54.14%,model
"On towing expenses, I agree with the Learned Adjudicator that even though the Appellant sought Kshs. 22,000.00, what was proved by way of an invoice endorsed with the word “paid” was Kshs. 6,000.00. I further agree that the Appellant proved the payment of Kshs. 5,000.00 for the assessment report by adducing a receipt for the same. On the alternative transport expenses of Kshs. 185,000.00, I note that the Appellant produced a receipt for the said sum. However, the Adjudicator rejected this claim and her reason for rejecting it on the ground that, “advocates do not work every day of the week,” is not a matter that the court could take judicial notice and was not supported by any evidence. The Appellant’s receipt was sufficient to prove his claim that he spent alternative transport expenses of Kshs. 185,000.00. In any case, the Respondent did not rebut this figure by proving that the Appellant could not have spent this amount. The award of Kshs. 75,000.00 was therefore without basis and is set aside. 
The Appellant did not produce any evidence of payment for garage storage charges. What is on record is a demand letter by the garage to the Appellant seeking this amount. As I have stated, a demand for payment is not proof of payment and therefore the Appellant did not prove that he had expended any sums on storage charges. This ground of appeal by the Respondent succeeds and the Adjudicator’s award of Kshs. 15,000.00 is set aside. 
Disposition 
For the above reasons, I find that both appeals partly succeed. In the circumstances, each party shall bear its own costs of the appeal.
The judgment of the Subordinate Court dated 06.02.2023 is set aside and substituted with the following judgment entered for the Appellant against the Respondent for:
Kshs. 196,000.00 made up as follows:
Assessment report charges – Kshs. 5,000.00
Towing expenses – Kshs. 6,000.00
Alternative transportation expenses – Kshs.185.000.00

This cause is non contentious as all the parties are in agreement with the distribution of the estate and have provided proposed modes of distribution. The 1st and 2nd Administrators filed their affidavit on the proposed mode of distribution on 11th September 2023 whereas the 3rd administrator filed hers on 14th November 2023.
Article 27 of the Constitution of Kenya provides as follows;
27. Equality and freedom from discrimination
(1) Every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law.
Section 38 of the Law of Succession Act provides as follows;
Where an intestate has left a surviving child or children but no spouse, the net intestate estate shall, subject to the provisions of sections 41 and 42, devolve upon the surviving child, if there be only one, or shall be equally divided among the surviving children.
Guided by the legal principles espoused in the statutes above and upon considering the affidavits on record and the proposed modes of distribution I hereby order that the estate of the deceased shall be distributed as follows;
Whereas the parties have agreed on the distribution, something must be said about the contentions Kshs. 30,000,000/- that was withdrawn for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the estate under mysterious circumstances. Section 55 of the Law of Succession Act states as follows;
(1) No grant of representation, whether or not limited in its terms, shall confer power to distribute any capital assets constituting a net estate, or to make any division of property, unless and until the grant has been confirmed as provided by section 71.
(2) The restriction on distribution under subsection (1) does not apply to the distribution or application before the grant of representation is confirmed of any income arising from the estate and received after the date of death whether the income arises in respect of a period wholly or partly before or after the date of death.",court,54.37%,model
"Further, as the withdrawal was instigated by one of the administrators, it is imperative that this court emphasize the  duties of administrators as was set out in section 83 of the Law of Succession Act as follows;
83. Personal representatives shall have the following duties-
(a) to provide and pay, out of the estate of the deceased, the expenses of a reasonable funeral for him; 
(b) to get in all free property of the deceased, including debts owing to him and moneys payable to his personal representatives by reason of his death;
(c) to pay, out of the estate of the deceased, all expenses of obtaining their grant of representation, and all other reasonable expenses of administration (including estate duty, if any);
(d) to ascertain and pay, out of the estate of the deceased, all his debts;
(e) within six months from the date of the grant, to produce to the court a full and accurate inventory of the assets and liabilities of the deceased and a full and accurate account of all dealings therewith up to the date of the account;
(f) subject to section 55, to distribute or to retain on trust (as the case may require) all assets remaining after payment of expenses and debts as provided by the preceding paragraphs of this section and the income therefrom, according to the respective beneficial interests therein under the will or on intestacy, as the case may be;
(g) within six months from the date of confirmation of the grant, or such longer period as the court may allow, to complete the administration of the estate in respect of all matters other than continuing trusts, and to produce to the court a full and accurate account of the completed administration.
(h) to produce to the court, if required by the court, either of its own motion or on the application of any interested party in the estate, a full and accurate inventory of the assets and liabilities of the deceased and a full and accurate account of all dealings therewith up to the date of the account;
(i) to complete the administration of the estate in respect of all matters other than continuing trusts and if required by the court, either of its own motion or on the application of any interested party in the estate, to produce to the court a full and accurate account of the completed administration.",court,53.57%,model
"In this cause there are three administrators and therefore, any decisions made with regards to the estate must have the input of all three administrators. It is apparent that the withdrawal of funds for the alleged purpose of defraying the expenses of the estate was at the instruction of one administrator and therefore there was no concurrence among the administrators. It is my considered view that this was in contravention of section 55 of the Law of Succession Act. However, I take note that the parties have since reached a resolution on how to settle this particular issue by distributing the balance of the sums equally amongst themselves upon recovery of the same and therefore there is no further dispute or contention as to the distribution of the estate.
The estate shall be distributed as stated above and the administrators are to render accounts within six months in order for the cause to be marked as closed.
It is so ordered.

MARTIN KHAEMBA WEKANYWA-------------------------------APPLICANT
VERSUS
WAMALWA SIMIYU & CO ADVOCATES-------------------RESPONDENT
RULING
The application before me is a notice of motion brought under certificate of urgency dated 7th February, 2023 and amended on 21st March,2023, pursuant to Article 40 of the constitution, section 3A of the Civil Procedure Act, Order 40 Rules 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10, Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules  seeking the following orders;
Spent
Spent 
That pending the hearing of and determination of the application the court be pleased to order the summoning of the court process server one David Imo for purposes of being cross-examined by the applicant’s counsel.
That pending the hearing of the suit inter-partes, the Court be pleased to issue an order compelling the 1st respondent from harassing the Applicant.
The costs of the application be borne by the Respondent.
The same is supported by an affidavit sworn by the Applicant who averred inter alia; that the Respondent through a firm of Auctioneers have been harassing him intending to execute a decree dated 26th October,2022 which emanated from an application dated 10th May,2019 whose service is highly disputed; that he stands to suffer irreparable damage if the court does not intervene; that he seeks to be granted  a chance to defend himself as he was not given an opportunity due to falsehoods of the process server.
The Respondent in opposition averred that the Applicant was duly served with the court documents as he was represented by his advocate on record; that the Auctioneer is immune to the proceedings by virtue of section 6 of the Judicature Act as it was executing lawful warrants which have not been challenged, recalled or set aside; that there is no illegality attributed to the Auctioneer and thus the application is an abuse of the court process  and which should be dismissed.",court,56.55%,model
"In their submissions dated 25th August,2023 the Respondent submitted that the orders as sought by the Applicants were against the court which is mandated to execute its decrees. Reliance was placed in the case of Michael Bartenge vs. Stephen Bartenge (2007) Eklr. Counsel submitted that the Applicant ought to have sought for stay orders and setting aside of the impugned decree since the calling of a process server for the purposes of cross examination would not have any effect and would be engaging the court in an academic exercise unless the decree is stayed/lifted.
I have considered the application and submissions. The history of the matter is that the Respondent filed an advocate-client bill of costs dated 24th June,2018 which was taxed off at Kshs.145,234/= and a certificate of costs issued on 22nd March,2019. The Respondent thereafter filed an application dated 10th May,2019 seeking to have the certificate of costs converted to a decree for purposes of execution. The application was allowed in the absence of the Applicant herein on 26th October,2022 after the court satisfied itself of service of the application upon the Applicant herein. As a result, the Respondent herein proceeded to execute the decree.  I find that the issue for determination is whether the applicant is entitled to the reliefs sought. 
The Applicant in his application sought for orders that the application be certified as urgent and for orders restraining the Respondent from auctioning his property which orders were granted in the interim. Further, the Applicant sought for an order summoning the Court process server for purposes of cross-examination pending hearing and determination of the application which order was not granted in the interim. The last two prayers were orders restraining the respondent from harassing the Applicant and a prayer for costs.
It is clear from the foregoing prayers that the Applicant is not seeking any orders beyond the inter parties hearing stage. Put differently, the applicant is not seeking any order to preserve any property or threatened legal or equitable right pending the hearing and determination of the instant application. I am aware that disputes will always arise during the execution stage in any litigation, but in the instant application none has been disclosed.
In Re Estate of Bakari Marakweli Mwakwisha (deceased) (2008) eKLR it was held:",court,56.89%,model
"“I am afraid the applicant did not seek any orders which may be granted.  His only substantive prayer was for the grant of an interlocutory injunction pending the hearing and determination of this application.  That order was granted at the time when the application was certified urgent.  It was to be in force pending the hearing and determination of the application.  Once the application is heard and determined, that order will have served its purpose, and there will be nothing more to be done.  Strictly speaking, indeed, there is no prayer to be heard.  The applicant ought to have included a prayer for an injunction pending the hearing and determination of the petition for the grant of letters of administration intestate.  But such injunction was not applied for, and the court cannot grant an order which is not prayed for.”
Even looking at the “orders” as sought without a substantive prayer, the application is misconceived and incompetent as any relief sought can only be granted if there is pending a substantive prayer, and that there is not one such in this application. Even so the prayer for orders restraining the Respondents from harassing the Applicant has not been substantiated. Clearly, the application is devoid of the requisite prayers which could act as an anchor. As it is, the orders sought are only ideal at the ex-parte stage but not the next stage as the same will have become spent. If that is the position, then there is nothing substantive for this court’s deliberation. As framed by the applicant, the orders are to subsist until the determination of the application interpartes. The applicant must be informed that we are now at the interpartes hearing stage and that the orders sought are deemed to have served the purpose and as such there is nothing that the court can deliberate upon. Again, it is noted that the application stems from an execution of decree process. As the applicant has not sought for an order of stay of execution of the decree, it is untenable to stop the executioner from carrying out its lawful duties. I find the prayers are not capable of being granted and that if the same is granted, the next question facing the applicant will be ‘’what next?’’
In view of the foregoing observations, I come to the finding that the application is devoid of merit. The same is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.
It is so ordered.

ERICK OMERI EMIRA ■CLAIMANT 
- VERSUS -
SECUREX AGENCIES (K) LTD ■………….RESPONDENT
(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the Memorandum of claim on 10.12.2018 through S.J Nyang & Co Advocates. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
An order compelling the respondent to pay the claimant his terminal dues and salary in lieu of notice all totalling to Kshs.340,087.00.
General damages for mental torture, stress anguish as a result of loss of employment. 
Reinstatement to employment together with withheld salary to date.
Costs of the claim and interest on (a) and (b) above at commercial rates. 
Or in the alternative payment of withheld salaries together with orders (a,b&c). 
The reply to claim was filed on 04.04.2019 through Simiyu Wekesa Advocates. The respondent prayed that the claimant’s suit against it be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant’s case was that he was an employee of the respondent from 02.02.2013 until 18.12.2015 when without reasonable justification, the respondent casually terminated his services without notice. 
That on 11.06.2015, the Kenya Power & Lighting Company through their employees or representatives made a malicious complaint to the Muthaiga Police Station to the effect that the claimant together with others had stolen a 22KVA transformer serial no. 1256438 at the Ruaraka Kenya power complex contrary to section 268 as read with section 275 of the Penal Code and later arraigned in court on the 18.06.2015 in criminal case no. 1925 of 2015 at Makadara law courts, Nairobi.
The claimant was tried before the Principal Magistrate’s Court at Makadara Law Courts where after lengthy trial the claimant was acquitted under section 210 of the criminal procedure code.",court,54.08%,model
"It is the claimant’s case that the respondent did not procedurally terminate his employment. Instead, it relied and focused on the allegations of theft, which allegations caused the claimant to be put in custody for some days, during which, he was alleged to have deserted duty and his services summarily terminated without giving him a fair hearing.  
The claimant stated that on 17.06.2015 he received a report from the main office of the respondent instructing him to inform his night shift colleagues not to leave the assignment the next day, 18.06.2015. 
That KPLC sent police officers to arrest the claimant and two of his colleagues Daniel Ouma and Peter Natembea. The police did not arrest the rest of the claimant’s colleagues who were twenty-seven in number. The claimant and his colleagues were held at Industrial Area Prisons, and the claimant was bailed out on 26.06.2015 by his uncle. 
The claimant pleaded that on 29.06.2015 he went to the respondent’s base office seeking to resume work, but, he was given a notice to report back to the base office on 02.07.2015 for a hearing. 
That on 02.07.2015 the claimant went to the respondent’s base office as instructed and met his colleague Peter Natembea who had equally been notified to attend a hearing on same day. That after 3 hours of waiting, they were informed that their area manager one Mr. Nderutu was not available and that they should leave and return on 07.07.2015. 
On 07.07.2015 the claimant arrived at the respondent’s offices at 0820 Hrs. He met discovered that his colleague Peter Natembea had already arrived. They were the informed that Mr. Nderutu, the human resource manager, operations and shop stewards were in a meeting, and that they should wait. 
When the meeting ended, Mr. Nderutu informed the claimant that he had to attend to an emergency in the field. Some of the shop stewards approached the claimant and Peter Natembea, and tried to convince them to write resignation letters so that they get paid quickly like their colleague Daniel Ouma.",court,51.06%,model
"The claimant and his colleague declined to write the resignation letters, and were informed to return to the respondent’s offices on 08.07.2015. 
On 08.07.2015 the claimant returned to the respondent’s offices. Mr. Nderutu was not available and thus the meeting could not take place. The respondent’s secretary asked the claimant to leave his contacts behind, which he states, he wrote down on a piece of paper. 
The claimant states that he fundraised amongst his friends and used the monies to relocate, together with his family, back to his home in Busia County. 
That on 11.01.2016 he returned to Nairobi purposely to collect his school certificates which were in the custody of the respondent. That he was requested to return the respondent’s property before being given his certificates, which he states he did on 12.01.2016. On the same date his certificates were handed over to him together with a certificate of service and a cheque for the days he had worked in the month of June 2015. 
On the part of the respondent, it admitted that the claimant was its employee, employed as a security guard effective 01.05.2011 to 30.06.2015 earning a basic salary of Kshs.12,221/= and a house allowance of Kshs.1,833.17/=. 
That on 09.06.2015 the claimant was assigned duties at Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) Ruaraka grounds. While on duty at the site, the claimant failed  to raise alarm or report vandalism of a transformer that occurred at KPLC Ruaraka grounds which was discovered the following day on 10.06.2015. 
The claimant was summoned by the respondent on the events that led to the transformer being vandalized and he prepared a written statement on his observations in relation to the security breach at KPLC Ruaraka grounds. 
The respondent stated that the claimant’s actions of failing to raise alarm of the theft resulted in him being issued with a notice to show cause on 29.06.2015. He was required to attend a disciplinary hearing on 02.07.2015.",court,51.97%,model
"The claimant did not show up for the disciplinary hearing on 02.07.2015 and no reason was given for the absence. The claimant having failed to appear for disciplinary proceedings and having been absent from duty without authority, the respondent summarily dismissed him. 
The respondent stated that the claimant showed up at the respondent’s premises on 13.01.2016 to collect his terminal dues. However, he did not offer an explanation on his whereabouts for the six months that he was absent from employment. 
The respondent paid his final dues and issued him a certificate of service. 
The Claimant filed his submissions. Despite service the respondent failed to attend at the hearing and failed to file final submissions. The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
To answer the 1st issue, there is no dispute that the parties were in a contract of service.
The 2nd issue is whether the contract of service was terminated. The respondent states that a notice to show cause was issued on 29.06.2015 for a disciplinary hearing on 02.07.2015. Further, that the claimant failed to show at the disciplinary hearing and resurfaced on 13.01.2016 to collect his terminal dues. The claimant’s account is that he received the notice to report back on 02.07.2015 but the hearing was adjourned to 07.07.2015. the claimant stated that on 07.07.2015 the Human Resource Manager for the second time was very busy to meet him and the shop steward who had been in a meeting with the Manager asked him to resign like his co-accused Daniel Ouma had done so as to be paid the worked days. He declined and was asked to go back on 08.07.2015 when the meeting could not take place but the secretary for the Manager asked her to record his address and to go home to be called later. He testified he never received the call until 15.07.2015 when it became unsustainable as he could no longer pay the rent and he did the fundraiser and travelled to his rural home in Busia. He came back to Nairobi on 11.01.2016, handed over and received the final cheque for days worked.",court,52.23%,model
"The Court finds that the claimant’s account upon his own testimony is not challenged at all. It was for the respondent to show that on 02.07.2015 the claimant had failed to attend the disciplinary hearing as envisaged in section 43 of the Employment Act. If indeed the claimant had failed to do so, it is not clear why the same could not be revived in January 2016 when the claimant showed up. Instead it appears the respondent decided to give a final pay cheque without reference to the disciplinary process. The Court finds that the respondent frustrated the disciplinary hearing. The Court finds that the procedure adopted was not fair as per section 41 of the Act. The disciplinary procedure having aborted at the instance of the respondent, it cannot be said that there was established reason for the termination as envisaged in section 43 of the Act. It was unfair in substance and procedure. The submissions made for the claimant are upheld. The claimant exhibits a letter dated 9.08.2018 addressed to his advocate by the respondent stating that the claimant was declared a deserter 18.12.2015 after receiving the letter to show cause dated 29.06.2015 and failing to attend a disciplinary hearing on 02.07.2015. Once again, the respondent fails to explain why the letter on desertion was not issued promptly on 02.07.2015, once again rendering the respondent’s account not probable on a balance of probability.
The 3rd issue is on remedies. The Court finds as follows:
The claimant was dismissed when the disciplinary process aborted at the respondent’s instance and it was without notice as he is awarded Kshs.22,000.00 in lieu of notice.
The court has considered the factors in section 12 of the Act. The aggravating factors are that the respondent failed to conclude the disciplinary process and subjected the claimant to unjustified adjournments. The Court has considered the period served and also considered the claimant otherwise had a clean record of service. He is awarded 8 months’ salaries in compensation making Kshs.176,000.00. 
There appears no material on record shows the claimant was a member of NSSF and the claim for service pay is declined.",court,53.72%,model
"The Court has considered the suffering the claimant went through for the manner he was dismissed and awarded 8 months’ salaries in compensation. The claimant has not shown justification for general damages for mental torture, stress and anguish as a separate heading for award. It is declined. There were no submissions made in that regard to justify the award. The submissions made for payment of withheld salaries are found baseless as no claim and prayer had been made in that regard. No submissions were made on the prayer for reinstatement and the same is deemed abandoned and correctly so as it was already statute barred, three years having lapsed from the date of the termination. The termination having been constructive effective 02.07.2015 when the disciplinary process aborted.
The claimant has succeeded and the respondent will pay costs.
In conclusion judgment is hereby entered for the claimant against the respondent for:
Payment of Kshs.198,000.00 by 31.12.2023 failing interest to be payable thereon at Court rates from the date of this judgment till full payment.

Costs be in the cause. 
The Respondent/Applicant has in reply filed a preliminary objection dated 25.10.2023. 
The preliminary objection was made upon the following grounds:
The Honourable Court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition by virtue of the claim being time-barred pursuant to section 3(2) of the Public Authorities Limitations Act, Cap 39, Laws of Kenya.
That the petitioner is attempting to circumvent the law on limitation of actions by relying on the constitutional provisions having realized that the matter is statute barred under the parent Acts which give effect to constitutional rights. 
That the petition is an abuse of court process 
That the petition is incompetent, bad in law, mala fides and ought to be struck out with costs. 
The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
The petitioner was terminated from the 1st respondent’s service on 08.02.2011. He had been charged in criminal case No. 434 0f 2011 and acquitted on 03.07.2015 and he says he instructed Ombeta & Associates to file suit for malicious prosecution and unfair termination but failed to afford the legal fees for the services. It appears that the only reason the petitioner is moving the Court belatedly is because he did not have fees to pursue the matter. The Court considers the reason advanced not to be plausible especially that the said instructions to counsel appear to have been at a time when the time of limitation as urged for the respondent had long lapsed. The Court finds that the cause of action is time barred as urged for the respondent and the petition is an abuse of Court Process.
In conclusion the notice of preliminary objection dated 25.10.2023 is hereby upheld and the petition herein dismissed with no orders on costs.

(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the Statement of claim on 12.06.2017 through Mbigi Njuguna & Co Advocates. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
Severance pay (15 days salary per month× 10 years worked) = Kshs.194,630 
Unpaid salary for 90 days (3 months) Kshs.38,926 ×3 months =116, 778 
Notice (3 months’ salary) Kshs.38,926 ×3 months = Kshs.116,778.00.
Costs of the suit. 
The Memorandum of response was filed on 24.08.2017 through Prof Albert Mumma & Co Advocates. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant’s case was that he was employed by the respondent on 11.11.2005 as a Moxy Dumper Operator earning a basic salary of Kshs.7,800 per month and a housing allowance of Kshs.1,600 per month. 
The claimant states that he was a in that position for approximately ten years from 11.11.2009 to 31.03.2015 when he was unfairly terminated vide a letter which stated that his services were no longer required. 
As at 31.03.2015 he was earning a gross salary of Kshs.38,926 with the net salary being Kshs.25,617. 
The claimant states that he was never given an opportunity to be heard and no credible reasons were given as to why his services were no longer required.",court,52.09%,model
"On the part of the respondent it was argued that the claimant’s letter of offer was a fixed term contract which was to subsist for 3 months each renewable over the period 11.11.2005 to 11.02.2016. 
That there was no contract capable of enforcement in law existing as at 31.03.2015 between the claimant and the respondent for the claimant to merit the monies sought. 
That there is no basis for service pay as sought. It is not provided in the employment contract between the claimant and the respondent.  Further, that there is no basis for a claim for unpaid salary for 90 days (3 months) as sought by the claimant as all monies owing to the claimant from its fixed term contract were duly paid to the claimant.
The respondent states that there is no basis for a claim for 3 months’ salary as sought because the letter of offer dated 11.11.2005 only provided for one week notice or one-week salary in lieu of notice. 
The respondent’s case was that the contract between the claimant and respondent was never renewed upon expiry. 
The Claimant filed his submissions. However, there are no submissions on record on the part of the respondent. The Court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.",court,52.76%,model
"To answer the 1st issue the Court returns that parties were in initially in a fixed term contract for three months. The respondent alleges the contracts were renewed over the period of relationship. Further, the respondent alleges that the last of the three-months contracts was for the term ending 31.03.2015. However, the Court finds that there are no subsequent monthly contracts exhibited. The claimant testified thus, “Last day at work was 31.03.2015. I see my exhibit No.2. Is termination letter dated 31.03.2015 effective 01.04.2015?”  The Court finds that while the initial contract was the three-months’ contract, when it lapsed there is no evidence that it was renewed. The parties are found to have been in a month to month contract of service until the respondent issued the letter of termination of services dated 31.03.2015 conveying that the claimant’s services were no longer required effective 01.04.2015 and to collect final dues on 10.04.2015.
To answer the 2nd issue, the Court finds the termination was abrupt without due notice. The claimant is awarded Kshs.38, 926.00 being one-month in lieu of notice and in view of section 35 of the Employment Act. The Court further finds that unpaid salary for 90 days was not established at all and, the 3 months’ notice pay had no contractual basis.",court,50.49%,model
"To answer the 3rd issue, the Court finds that the termination was unfair. The respondent has offered no evidence to show that the claimant’s services were indeed not required and the reason has not been shown to have existed as at termination as envisaged in section 43 of the Act. The claimant’s submission is upheld. If indeed his services were not required, then it amounted to redundancy per section 40 of the Act but due procedure under the section was not invoked. The Court has considered the provisions in section 40 of the Act. The claimant worked without break from 11.11.2005 to 31.03.2015. It makes 9 complete years and due severance pay would be about 5 months’ salary at half month salary. He is awarded 9 x 0.5 x 38, 926.00 for severance pay as claimed in amended claim making Kshs.175,167.00. having succeeded in his claim, the costs are granted.
In conclusion judgment is hereby entered for the claimant against the respondent for:
Payment of Kshs.214,093.00 by 31.12.2023 failing interest at Court rates be payable thereon from the date of filing the suit till full payment.

of its discretion as required by the law; that the applicants have not offered any security for the due performance of the decree and costs  that were assessed in the lower court matter plus interest as required by Order 42 Rule 6 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules; that the application be dismissed with costs as the applicants have not met the required   threshold  to warrant the application being allowed;,court,56.66%,model
"The application was canvassed by way of written submissions. The applicants   filed their submissions dated 25th August 2023 while the respondents relied on their replying affidavit sworn on 20th day of July, 2023. 
I have given due consideration to the rival affidavits and submissions. I find that the issue of for determination is whether the application meets the threshold to warrant grant of an order of stay of execution pending determination of the Appellants’ appeal. 
It is trite that an application seeking stay of execution must meet the clear provisions of Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides in summary as follows:
‘’No order for stay of execution shall be made under sub rule (1) unless-
  The court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
Such security as the court may order for the due performance of such decree or order as it may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.’’
As to whether the application has been filed without undue delay, it is noted that the impugned ruling was delivered on 14/6/2023 while the Memorandum of Appeal was filed on 3/7/2023. It is thus clear that there was no inordinate delay at all on the part of the Appellant/Applicant. That condition has been met.
As regards the issue of whether the applicant will suffer substantial loss, the applicant has beseeched this court for intervention since according to them, the appeal will be rendered nugatory if orders of stay are not granted at this stage as the Respondent has already taken out warrants and is ready to execute. It is not in doubt that substantial loss does not represent any particular amount or size whether monetary or otherwise. It is sufficient that the applicant can show that the execution is likely to put into motion other state of affairs which will substantially affect the Appellant as the eventual successful party in the appeal. See James Wangalwa & Another V. Agnes Naliaka Cheseto [2020] eKLR.",court,55.81%,model
"The Respondents have averred that they are persons of means and that they do farming and will be in a position to refund the decretal sums in the event of success of appeal. However, the Respondents did not go further by presenting evidence to the effect that indeed they are not persons of straw such as by availing bank statements etc. This thus bolsters the Appellants’ concerns that they are likely to have a paper judgement in the event of success of appeal as the Respondents will not be in a position to refund the monies already paid to them. I find that the Appellants have satisfied this condition.
As regards the issue of security, the Appellants have averred that they are ready and willing to provide security for the due performance of the decree and that they are ready to abide by any condition to be imposed by the court. Indeed, the Respondents are the decree holders and already on the seat of judgement and that they ought to enjoy the fruits of that judgement. If the Appellants are now seeking to stand in their way, then they must see to it that the Respondents’ concerns are taken care of. On the other hand, the Appellants are also entitled to ventilate their appeal otherwise the same might be rendered nugatory. In order to balance their rival concerns, I find that an order that the Appellants deposit the entire decretal sums into a joint interest earning account in the joint names of the Advocates for the parties pending determination of the appeal will be appropriate in the circumstances.
In the result, I find merit in the Appellants application dated 30/6/2023. The same is allowed in the following terms:
 
An order of stay of execution of the decree and all consequential orders in Bungoma CMCC No. 456 of 2016 is hereby granted upon the Appellants depositing the entire decretal amount plus assessed costs as disclosed on the warrants of attachment into a joint interest earning account in the names of both Advocates within fourteen (14) days from the date of this ruling failing which the stay shall lapse.
The costs of the application shall abide in the appeal.

That on 25.04.2019 the claimant signed a salary review memorandum dated 24.04.2019 which stated that with effect from 01.04.2019 the claimant’s basic salary would be Kshs.426,368.25. 
That for the ten years that the claimant served the respondent, no complaint was raised about his performance. 
On 15.03.2021 the claimant received a letter suspending his employment for alleged breach of terms and conditions of his contract and the company’s code of conduct. 
The claimant states that he replied to said letter, through his letter dated 17.03.2021, informing the respondent of the need to specify the acts by the claimants or conduct which amounted to the alleged breaches. 
In a letter dated 24.03.2021 the respondent requested the claimant so show cause why the company should not take disciplinary action against him. 
Through a letter dated 27.03.2021 the claimant states that he responded to the respondent’s show cause letter addressing each allegation. 
By a letter dated 03.03.2021 the respondent invited the claimant to attend a disciplinary hearing on 31.03.2021, to which the claimant honoured the invitation and attended the hearing. 
The claimant contends that the disciplinary hearing was not carried out in accordance with fair labour practices, and was unfair for reasons that he was not informed of the particular charges he was facing, prior to the meeting. 
The claimant pleaded that he followed all company procedures while discharging his duties as supply chain director and that he acted in good faith while discharging said duties.",court,51.93%,model
"The claimant states that Inyani enterprises, allegedly owned by him is non-existent, and the same can be proved by conducting searches with the companies’ registry. 
On the part of the respondents it is stated that the respondent received anonymous information about possible fraud in its operations, which allegedly involved the respondent’s staff.  Over a period of time the respondent reviewed its operations with the aim of identifying the possible problem areas and the extent, if any, of the fraud. The respondent engaged Stealth Africa Consulting Limited to assist with investigating areas where suspicious activities were noted. 
In March 2021 the respondent directed its review towards members of staff who regularly dealt with or had contacts with suppliers. During this review, the respondent states that it received anonymous information regarding the activities of various staff members. In respect of the claimant it was alleged that he had been involved in or aided and abetted activities that breached the respondent’s requirement that staff act with integrity and promote a culture of ethics and compliance, and that he was involved in activities that constituted conflict of interest. 
The respondent states that in view of the general nature of the information that the respondent had received anonymously, the respondent considered that it was necessary to commission an investigation to ascertain the full facts and circumstances relating to the alleged breaches. 
Consequently, the respondent suspended the claimant from employment vide a letter dated 15.03.2021 in order to facilitate the carrying out of an investigation. The claimant was informed of the suspension as well as the reasons and terms thereof. 
Stealth Africa Consulting Limited conducted the investigations by interviewing staff members, conducting analysis of forensic images from the laptop that the respondent assigned the claimant for work purposes and the carrying out of company and business searches. 
On or about 23.03.2021 an investigation report was submitted by Stealth Africa Consulting to the respondent, as regards the aforesaid investigations. The respondent states that the investigation report identified various alleged breaches by the claimant together with evidence supporting the alleged breaches. 
The respondent considered the above and decided to give the claimant an opportunity to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him. 
That by a letter dated 24.03.2021 the respondent informed the claimant of the alleged breaches and requested him to show cause in writing on or before 27.03.2021 why disciplinary action should not be taken against him.",court,50.97%,model
"The claimant did not request for additional time to prepare his response, but responded through his letter of 27.03.2021. Upon receiving the response the respondent reviewed it and found it unsatisfactory and instead decided to convene a disciplinary hearing. 
By a letter dated 30.03.2021 the respondent invited the claimant for a disciplinary hearing, in which it informed the claimant of his right to be accompanied to the disciplinary hearing by a fellow work colleague of his choice. 
The respondent states that the claimant did not request for additional time to prepare for the disciplinary hearing. 
By a letter dated 01.04.2021 the respondent terminated the claimant’s employment by summary dismissal. In the said letter, the respondent advised the claimant of his right to appeal against the decision to terminate him, however, the claimant did not exercise this right. 
The parties filed their respective submissions. The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
To answer the 1st issue, the Court returns that there is no dispute that parties were in a contract of service. The respondent employed the claimant as the Supply Chain Manager by the letter dated 21.12.2010 effective 01.03,2011. He was promoted to Supply Chain Director by the letter dated 09.12.2016. By letter dated 24.04.2019 his salary was increased to Kshs.426,368.25.
To answer the 2nd issue, there is no dispute that the contract of employment was terminated by the letter of summary dismissal dated 01.04.2021 on account of gross misconduct upon particulars enumerated in the letter. The termination was effective 01.04.2021. He was to be paid prorated salary up to and including 01.04.2021, the last day of service; leave accrued but not taken; and, gratuity.",court,51.36%,model
"The 3rd issue is whether the termination was unfair. On procedure, the claimant was suspended by the letter dated 15.03.2021. While testifying that the suspension was imposed without prior warning and reasons disclosed, the letter refers to a meeting on 15.03.2021 between the claimant and the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mr. Olivier Thiry, the Managing Director (MD) Mr. Mark C. Williams; Doris Njoroge the Human Resource Manager (HRM). The letter states that at the meeting the claimant had been informed about information suggesting that he had breached the terms and conditions of service of the employment and provisions of the respondent’s Code of Business Conduct relating to claimant’s acting with integrity and promotion of a culture of ethics and compliance; the protection and use of the Company’s assets; and compliance with rules on conflict of interest. He was therefore suspended pending the investigations. The claimant says that the suspension was unfair for want of particulars of the allegations. The Court finds that concern unfounded because the suspension was clearly a preliminary decision pending investigation. It appears that investigations were to be carried out to crystallise the allegations. Further, the claimant had attended the meeting and was informed the circumstances prior to suspension. The Court finds that the suspension being a preliminary decision based on preliminary inquiry, the respondent had not adopted an unfair procedure in the manner the suspension had been imposed. The letter was categorical that the suspension was on full pay as the claimant remained an employee. The letter further stated that the suspension was not a disciplinary sanction but it was a necessary tool to facilitate the investigation referred to in the letter. It was categorical that the company would contact him and convey the findings once the investigations were completed. In all circumstances and as submitted for the respondent the suspension has not been shown to have been unlawful or unfair in the circumstances of the case.
Further on procedure, the claimant confirmed he received the request to show cause being the letter dated 24.03.2021. It was allegations were levelled against the claimant as follows:",court,51.25%,model
"Breach of the respondent’s Code of Business Conduct and terms of employment by causing or abetting aiding and abetting the making of payments to supposed suppliers of the respondent for fictitious supplies hence loss of respondent’s funds. That included claimant’s approval of Local Purchase Orders (LPOs) for the supposed suppliers knowing well that supplies had not been delivered by the supposed suppliers. Such suppliers included Gibcoll Enterprises which was paid Kshs. 1,250,545.00 for fictitious supply of spare parts and consumables between January and November 2020; Koyitoror Merchants Limited which was paid a total of Kshs.257,720.00 for supply of spare parts and consumables between January and November 2020; and Toror Merchants and Lyne and Alia Engineering Ltd.
In breach of the Code he received Kshs.25,000.00 from Patel Mondish Kumar Dineshkumar on 04.03.2020 and who was the Manager at Bindip Ltd, a supplier of the Company.
None disclosure of multiple interests including  directorship or shareholding- by using company assets for personal benefit or for the benefit of other persons; using the respondent’s assets, computer and equipment for outside business or unethical activities; engaging in personal activities during working hours. The allegations included use of respondent’s intellectual property such as on 07.08.2020 he prepared a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) between himself and Royal Converters Limited to provide consultancy services in the development of an extrusion process for textured vegetable protein in circumstances that Royal Converters Limited was not a customer of the Company and had no business relationship with the company. The MOU had been prepared using respondent’s time and laptop. Under the allegation, other specific allegations whose specifics were stated were levelled against the claimant.",negotiable,50.43%,model
"The claimant replied the letter to show cause by his letter dated 26.03.2021. He denied making the LPOs; he denied knowing the mentioned suppliers subject of the LPOs allegations and finance director was answerable on how payments may have been effected; he had not received money from Patel Mondish in capacity as company supplier and allegations were intrusive of his privacy in illegal access of his mobile phone; the MOU remained a draft and there was no contractual relationship or as Inyani Enterprises Consultancy or Limited was a fictitious company; he had used company time and laptop or equipment because he desired that the same communication be in respondent’s best interest and acted with utmost good faith.
Further by letter dated 30.03.2021 he was invited to attend the disciplinary hearing which he attended on 31.03.2021. The dismissal letter was dated 01.04.2021.
The Court finds that the procedure adopted by the respondent was per the prescribed notice and hearing in section 41 of the Employment Act. While alleging that the time to defend himself was short, he as well confirmed that he never asked for the extension of the time to prepare.  He lamented that the investigation report was not provided but despite the request to show cause stating that the investigation report had made the specific findings per the levelled allegations, he ably made his response to each allegation by the letter dated 26.03.2021 without asking for the report or suggesting that he needed details about the findings beyond what was in the request to show cause. Thus, as submitted for the respondent, the procedure was not unfair at all.",court,50.73%,model
"For the reasons for termination the Court returns that the respondent has established that they were valid as per section 43 of the Employment Act and as well, they were fair per section 45 of the Act as they related to the respondent’s operational requirements and, the claimant’s compatibility and conduct. The claimant did not deny but admitted using the respondent’s time and equipment to draw the MOU. The MOU, he admitted, had been drawn yet it amounted to a design to unfairly interfere with the respondent’s enterprise. The claimant admitted in his testimony that he had communicated as was alleged against him and urged that it was in the respondent’s best interest. How that could be was not demonstrated at all. As submitted for the respondent, there is nothing on record which, on a balance of probability, would exculpate the claimant. The Court finds that claimant 100% contributed to his summary dismissal when he breached the terms and code of service as was alleged. The respondent’s submissions are upheld in that regard.
Thus, the Court returns that the termination was not unfair both in procedure and substance.
The 4th issue is on remedies. The Court returns that the claimant has not established any of the remedies as being justified. One-month notice-pay and compensation were based on a return that the declarations as prayed for are awarded. The Court has found they are not justified at all. Offshore quarterly net payment was futuristic per the claimant’s own testimony and the Court finds they were unjustified. The suit must therefore collapse with costs.
In conclusion the suit is hereby dismissed with costs for the respondent, and, the Deputy registrar to cause the court file to be returned to the Machakos Court’s sub-registry forthwith.

********************
RULING
The Application dated 1st August, 2023 brought pursuant to Rule 4 Court of Appeal Rules, 2010 seeks;
Leave for extension of time to file a notice of appeal; and the intended appeal;
that the annexed memorandum of appeal be deemed as properly on record, and be admitted for hearing;
there be stay of execution of the ruling delivered on 30th November 2021, pending hearing and determination of the application and the intended appeal;
costs be in the cause.
The application is supported by the affidavit of even date sworn by Richard Mapesa Matuli who deposes that due to ill health, he was not in a position to instruct his counsel to file the appeal in a timely manner, although his advocate has now requested for the decree as well as the certified typed proceedings emanating from the court; and a draft notice of appeal has also been prepared.
The matter was listed for hearing on 1st November 2023, but the respondent had not filed any response to the application; and none of the parties filed any written submissions. The only rational conclusion to make is that the applicant has lost interest in the matter which is now deemed as unprosecuted. It is thus dismissed for want of prosecution under rule 58 (1) of the Court of Appeal Rules. I make no orders on costs.

OLIVER THANDI MUNYUA ■APPLICANT 
- VERSUS -
ABSA BANK KENYA PLC……………...………RESPONDENT
 (Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
RULING
The applicant filed the application dated 03.10.2023 through J.A. Guserwa &Company Advocates. It was under Articles 41 and 47 of the Constitution and Rule 17 of the Employment & Labour Relations Court (Procedure) Rules 2016 and all other enabling provisions of law. The prayer is for grant to the applicant leave to file his petition out of time and the annexed petition be admitted by the Court for hearing and determination, and, costs of the application.
The application is based upon the annexed applicant’s supporting affidavit and is urged as follows:
The applicant was in the lawful employment of the respondent as the Branch Operations Officer since 2008.
By letter dated 23.03.2018 the respondent terminated the applicant’s position unlawfully and contrary to his right to fair labour practices. He applied for a review by his letter dated 29.03.2018 but the appeal against the summary dismissal was upheld by the respondent’s letter dated 10.05.2018.
The applicant was subjected to criminal proceedings that were determined on the 25.05.2023 long after the time for filing the instant suit had expired. It was a decision upon appeal before the High Court (Grace L. Nzioka J).
The applicant seeks to be compensated by the respondent, his former employer.
The respondent filed the replying affidavit of Mikah Gachanja, respondent’s Legal Counsel sworn on 18.10.2023 together with grounds of opposition both filed through Mboya Wangongu’u & Waiyaki Advocates. The grounds of opposition were as follows:
Section 90 of the Employment Act does not admit of any leave to file a petition out of time of limitation of 3-years for disputes relating to contracts of employment.",court,54.37%,model
"Part III of the Limitation of Actions Act Cap 22 does not apply as to permit leave as prayed for to file the petition.
The petitioner has not advanced a good reason for not filing the petition or claim prior to lapsing of the time of limitation.
The application is unduly delayed filed 130 days after the decision in the criminal appeal delivered on 25.05.2023.
The cause of action accrued more than 5-years ago. It is prejudicial to require the respondent to defend such action but for the applicant’s indolence.
The proposed suit has low chances of success because the summary dismissal was with due procedure and a fair reason. Further, the Court in the criminal appeal judgment found the applicant had not conducted due diligence and was negligent. No material is exhibited to support the proposed petition.
Submissions were filed for the parties. The Court has considred the material on record.
The only issue is whether the Court should exercise discretion in favour of the applicant to grant leave for filing of petition belatedly and the time of limitation under section 90 of the Employment Act, 2007 having lapsed. As urged for the respondent there is no disabling ground established why the applicant failed to file suit prior to lapsing of the time of limitation in section 90 of the Act. It is that a petition to enforce fundamental freedoms and rights can be entertained belatedly despite statutory time of limitation provided the petitioner establishes the disabling circumstances that may have made it impossible to move the Court within the prescribed time lines. Such factors have not been established and even if they existed, the procedure would be to simply file the petition as merited and any objections in that regard established and urged in the petition if objections on time of limitation are raised.  
The Court considers that where petitions are entertained despite periods of limitation, it is not that the Court is then granting leave but that in the circumstances the cause of action in the petition is found valid as urged and, in the circumstances, not being urged on the basis of leave granted. The Court finds that no provision of law has been urged granting the Court the jurisdiction or pwer to extend time or grant leave as prayed for.
It appears that, as submitted for the respondent, after the summary dismissal and rejection of the administrative appeal or review, the cause of action crystallised but the applicant offers no explanation why he failed to promptly move the Court.",court,57.87%,model
"The Court has considered all the circumstances including the acquittal in the criminal appeal and returns no orders on costs.
The application is hereby dismissed with no orders on costs.

JOSEPH MULINGE KILO ……………………..........RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the judgment and decree of Hon. A. N. Makau (PM) in Milimani CMCC No. 1719 of 2019 delivered on 24/2/2020)
JUDGMENT
The respondent in this appeal, JOSEPH MULINGE KILO filed Milimani CMCC no. 1719 of 2019 seeking general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities and special damages of ksh.3,550/= together with costs and interest for injuries the respondent sustained on 22/4/2018 while the respondent was riding motor cycle registration no. KMET 654V when it was hit by the 1st appellants motor vehicle registration no. KCF 750U.
The respondent who suffered cut wound web of the 2nd and 3rd fingers on the left hand, bruises on the left thumb, cut wound on the left leg, swollen tender left leg and blunt injury on the hip region blamed the 2nd appellants motor vehicle for the accident.
The trial court found that both the rider and the motor vehicle were to blame of the accident and apportioned liability at 80:20% in favour of the respondent against the appellants.
The trial court assessed quantum of damages as follows;
General damages for pain & suffering ■ksh.300,000
Special damages ■■■■ksh.    3,550
Total■■■■■■■ksh.303,550
Less 20% contributory negligence■ksh.242,840
The appellants have appealed against the said judgment and decree for the following reasons.
That the learned magistrate erred in law in failing to consider the provisions of the Traffic Act Cap 403 and the traffic rules thereunder as a result, arrived at an erroneous conclusion",court,54.47%,model
"That the learned magistrate erred in fact by failing to scrutinize/evaluate the evidence tendered in this matter and as a result held the appellants wholly liable for the accident
The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to scrutinize the evidence tendered in support of the injuries suffered by the respondent and to correctly relate them to case law cited and as a result failed to arrive at a fair and reasonable compensation for the said injuries.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to find that the nature of the injuries by the respondent did not warrant an award of general damages of Kshs. 300,000
That the learned magistrate erred in law by failing to properly consider the appellants’ defence, evidence and submissions and in doing so arrived at an erroneous conclusion.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact by awarding an inordinately high award of damages for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.
The appellant submitted that the respondent does not give a comprehensive account of the accident but merely avers that he was lawfully riding motor cycle registration number KMEB 131Y along Ngong road-Green house when the driver of motor vehicle KCF 750U carelessly drove at high speed that it lost control and hit his motorcycle causing him very serious injuries.
The Appellants’ account of the accident, which was uncontroverted during trial was that on the fateful day at around 1:00 pm, the 2nd Appellant was driving motor vehicle registration number KCF 750U along Ngong Road intending to turn right into Ngong Lane. The visibility was clear and there was minimal road traffic.
 The 2nd Appellant indicated that he was turning right and once ascertaining the road was clear, turned right towards Double Tree Hotel and he had already turned when motor vehicle registration KMEB 131Y coming from the direction of Prestige Mall, hit its rear bumper.  That from the foregoing, it is clear that the accident occurred when the motor cycle registration number KMET 131Y hit the rear of motor vehicle registration number KCF 750U.",court,55.14%,model
"The appellant argued that the respondent did not adduce any eye witness evidence to support his version of events from which he seeks the court to hold that the 2nd appellant is liable for the accident. he did not adduce any evidence proving that the 2nd appellant was driving the motor vehicle at an excessive speed and further the police abstract dates 11/7/2018 confirms the occurrence of an accident but does not state who the police blame for the accident.
It was therefore the appellants argument that the respondent failed to discharge his burden of proof to the required standard pursuant to section 108 and 109 of the evidence Act and the trial court erred in holding the appellants liable for the accident either wholly of partially.
On damages the appellant submitted that from the medical report dated 15/10/2019 the respondent suffered bruises in the left hand, cut wound on the left shin and blunt injury right hip region. It was the appellants argument that kshs. 300,000 was excessive and that an award of Kshs. 150,000 would be sufficient based on comparable cases. In support the appellants cited Ahmed Said Amadi v Jacob Fundi Mugo [2021] eKLR: where, the respondent herein was medically examined on 11th July, 2012. He sustained a cut to the head, lacerations on both the upper and lower lip, and an abrasion on the right elbow. PW2 indicated that the respondent would recover fully with no disability. The High Court awarded general damages of Kshs. 150,000.00
The respondent submitted that the trial court was justified in its findings on liability considering the evidence that was adduced by both parties. the trial court found that the 2nd appellant joined the road when it was not clear for her and determined that the appellants were 80% liable.
On damages the respondent argued that Kshs 300,000 as damages was sufficient and in support cited a decision of the High Court in the case of Robinson Njoroge v Daniel Obasa [2021] eKLR where the court upheld Kshs. 300,000 for comparable injuries.",court,55.92%,model
"This being a first appeal, the duty of the first appellate court is to re-evaluate the evidence adduced before the trial court and to arrive at its own conclusion whether to support the findings of the trial court while bearing in mind that the trial court had the opportunity of seeing the witnesses. In Selle –Vs- Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 it was held in the following terms: -
“An appeal from the High Court is by way of re-trial and the Court of Appeal is not bound to follow the trial judge’s finding of fact if it appears either that he failed to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities, or if the impression of the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence generally.
An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled.  Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect.
In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate the evidence or if the impression based on the demeanor of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.” 
The issues for determination are as follows;
Whether the trial court was right on its findings on liability.
Whether the award of damages was inordinately high.
Whether the trial court failed to considered the defence and arrived at an erroneous decision.
On the issue as to whether the trial court was right in its findings on liability, the record is clear that the motor cycle hit the car from the back.
The trial court found that the 2nd appellant confirmed that the rider hit the motor vehicle at the rear.
The trial court said that the 2nd appellant knew that the rider had a right of way and she ought to have given way before joining the road.
The trial court also found that the rider ought to have slowed down to avoid hitting the motor vehicle at the rear.",court,56.54%,model
"In the circumstances, I find that the court was not right on its findings on liability. I have re-evaluated the evidence and find that both were to blame for the accident and the court ought to have apportioned liability at 50:50%.
I accordingly set aside 80:20% ratio and substitute it with 50:50% liability for reasons that although the 1st appellant was hit at the rear, there is evidence she had already joined the road when she was hit at the back.
On the issue as to whether the award was inordinately high, I have considered the authorities relied on by the trial court and I find they were comparable.
The respondent sustained soft tissue injuries.
In Catherine Wanjiru Kingori & 3 Others v Gibson Theuri Gichubi [2005] eKLR the plaintiff therein suffered injuries on the left ankle, injuries on the legs and chest, dislocation of the left wrist, fracture of the radius and ulna and soft tissue injuries to the face. The Court awarded general damages of Kshs. 300,000 in 2005.
In Francis Ndungu Wambui & 2 others v Benson Maina Gatia [2019] eKLR quite recently, the High Court reviewed downwards an award of general damages of Kshs. 400,000 to Kshs. 300,000 for injuries of head injury with loss of consciousness and soft tissue injuries.
I find kshs.300,000 reasonable in the circumstances of this case. 
 I also find that the defence by the Appellant was referred to in the judgment.
I accordingly adjust the amount payable as follows
Liability is adjusted to 50:50% in against the appellant in favour of the respondent 
General damages for pain &suffering 300,000
Special damages■■■■      3,550
Total■■■■■■■ 303,550
Less 50% liability■■■■151,775
The trial court’s judgment is set aside and substituted with judgment in favour of the respondent against the appellants in the sum of ksh.151,775 with costs and interest from the time of the judgment of the trial court until payment in full.

The claimant filed the statement of claim on 22.05.2019.  The claimant as pleaded, was employed by the 1st respondent in 2013 and initially on casual basis. The respondent issued the letter dated 01.03.2019. It conveyed that the respondent had lost confidence and trust in the claimant and his last working day would be on 01.03.2019. he was directed not to report to work in the month of March but he would receive his pay check at the end of March 2019. His certificate of service was attached on that letter of termination of employment. The certificate stated that he had worked for the 1st respondent from January 2013 as a consultant up to September 2014. Further, he was a full time employee from August 2014 to 1st March 2019. The certificate and the letter were signed by the 2nd respondent as the President of the 1st respondent.

The respondent filed the statement of response on 06.02.2021 through Archer & Wilcock Advocates. The respondent admitted employing the claimant and as at termination the prevailing contract of service was the one dated 01.04.2018. and he served as a driver or Program Training Support Team Member in the 1st respondent’s establishment. The respondent further pleaded as follows. On 28.01.2019 the 1st respondent lost several assets through internal theft. A staff meeting was called and the claimant and other two staff members were summoned and heard in self-explanation. The 1st respondent considered the proceedings and lost trust and confidence in the claimant and the contract was terminated in accordance of with the terms and conditions of service. The claimant was paid one-month salary in lieu of notice and he unreservedly acknowledged receipt. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs as lacking in merits.
The claimant testified to support his case. The respondent’s witness (RW) was Pauline M. Gathanga, the 1st respondent’s Program Manager. Final submissions were filed for the parties.
There is no dispute that the parties were in a contract of service and the contract was terminated by the letter dated 01.03.2019. 
Was the termination unfair? By his own testimony the claimant confirmed that on 28.01.2019 some incident took place because the 1st respondent’s office was broken into and some items stolen. Further, he confirmed that thereafter a meeting was convened and everyone was investigated and he gave his version of the account. After the meeting he was given a notice of termination of the contract of employment dated 01.03.2019. he confirmed that earlier in his service on 29.01.2018 he was arrested surrounding some banking event but later he was released and continued working for the 1st respondent. RW testified that as at termination of the claimant the issue of theft was under investigation.",court,50.79%,model
"The Court has considered the material evidence that a meeting was held following the theft and the 1st respondent concluded it had lost confidence in the claimant and terminated per termination clause. The Court considers that as urged for the respondents, the 1st respondent was entitled to invoke the contractual termination clause which is as well recognised in section 35 of the Employment Act. In the circumstances it cannot be said that the reason for termination was unfair or the procedure was unfair. The Court upholds the respondent’s case and submission in that regard and in view of sections 43 and 45 of the Act. It was submitted for the claimant that it was unfair for want of a genuine reason per section 43 and due procedure per section 41 of the Employment Act, 2007. The Court has found that the invoked contractual clause was available in the circumstances of the case and loss of trust and confidence appears to have been a genuine reason, the claimant and RW having confirmed the theft in issue and the investigative meeting indeed took place. The reason for termination was diminished trust and confidence and the procedure was invoking the contractual termination clause. It is not for the Court to get into the respondent’s mind to graduate impact of the incidence and trust or confidence levels. What is important is that the theft took place and in the circumstances, it is not far fetched that the trust and confidence dwindled or likely diminished. The Court will not interfere with the respondents’ discretion in that regard to terminate the contract of service.
The Court returns that as submitted for the respondents, the claimant has not shown statutory or contractual or other basis for claiming Kshs.6,734, 640.00 salary for 5 years. As for gratuity, as urged for the respondent, it is not due per section 35 of the Act because the claimant was a member of the National Social Security Fund. For the claim of leave, the claimant confirmed that he had taken all his leave days. The claimant would not be entitled to receive statutory deduction dues and any failures in that regard would fall for resolution under the relevant statutes.
In conclusion the suit is hereby dismissed with costs.

CIVIL CASE NO. 136 OF 2018

RULING
The application coming for consideration in this ruling is the one dated 6/12/2018 brought under Order 2 Rule 15, Order 6 and Order 51 rule 1 of the Civil Proceedings rules 2010 seeking the following prayers
The plaint dated 11th June 2018 and lodged by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs be struck out in respect of the allegations against the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant.
That costs of this application be borne by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs.
The application is based on the grounds on the face of it as follows;
The plaintiff filed the plaint dated 11th June, 2018 out of time and it is therefore time barred due to limitation of time.
That notwithstanding, the plaint is based on a grave misconception about the employment and engagement of the 1st defendant not a publisher.
The plaintiff’s plaint is sub judice as it seeks to use the forum of this honourable court to litigate and influence court matters that are pending adjudication in various other courts.
The plaintiffs’ plaint is based on allegations that are contrary to the freedoms of speech guaranteed under article 33 of the constitution of Kenya.
The plaintiffs have not specifically disclosed how the alleged publications have undermined their reputation and character in the eyes of the right thinking members of the society.
The plaintiff does not disclose a reasonable cause of action for a defamation suit, let alone a cause of action against the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant.",court,55.72%,model
"The plaintiffs’ allegations of harassments and malice are mere allegations as they are devoid of concise and specific particulars with respect to the 1st defendant and 2nde defendant.
The plaintiffs allegations are unrelated and are farfetched and thus cannot be linked to the alleged cause of defamation that the plaintiffs very unimaginatively strive to pursue on the instance case.
The plaintiffs’ imputations of gross criminal behavior by the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant are based on plaintiffs’ opinions and actions which are contrary to the express provisions of criminal and land laws on finding of guilt and placement of caveats hence it is an abuse of the court process.
The plaintiff is significantly based on wild and unfounded allegations against the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant that are completely unrelated and remote to their insinuation of defamation.
The plaint as filed has no legs to stand on and should be cut off at the knees to/and avoid an expensive and wholly unnecessary waste of scarce judicial time and resources; an act that is inimical to public policy interest.
It is in the interest of justice that the plaint dated 11th June, 2018 be struck out with costs at the earliest opportunity as it discloses no reasonable cause of action against the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant and lacks merit.   
The plaintiff filed a replying affidavit sworn on 31/5/2019 by CHRISTOPHER BARRON opposing the application dated 6/12/2018 in which it is deposed that the application herein is an abuse of court process. the application is too general in its nature and failed to particularize the ground the 1st and 2nd defendants are seeking to rely on to have this suit struck out.
He stated that in his affidavit the 1st defendant make it appear that he is the founder of Tatu City Project yet the same is blatantly false. The 1st defendant is only concerned about his own personal interests and not those of the companies and their project. The 1st defendant and his proxies have taken all steps necessary to try and bring the projects to a stand still to the detriment of the plaintiffs and its stakeholders.",court,55.59%,model
"He averred that the articles that were complained about were facilitating and procured at the behest and instructions of the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant procured the 4th defendant to cover the story allegedly that the 1st and 2nd plaintiff were embroiled in a row with villagers over Tatu City Properties. This position is false. This was intended to destroy the image and reputation of the plaintiffs and their associate companies. The same was done with ill intent to insert pressure upon the plaintiffs and force them to undergo economic harm and damages.
The 1st defendant also procured the 5th and 6th defendants to publish a story in the business daily edition dated 23/5/2018 under the caption “Land Officials entangled in Tatu City fraud claims” concerning the 1st defendants claim in another constitutional petition namely Thika ELC Petition No. 5 of 2018 which was later withdrawn by the 1st defendant herein.
He stated that the stories complained of have been published by the 4th , 5th and 6th defendant at the 1st defendant’s instance in the expectation that such an adverse publicity will prevent the development of the Tatu City Project otherwise paralyze the 1st and 2nd plaintiff’s operations thus creating a leverage for the 1st defendant to try and force a buy-out of his one share on his terms.
The parties filed written submissions as follows: the 1st defendants submitted that to sustain a suit for defamation, the Plaintiff must prove that there were either words or publication and that they were defamatory in that they lowered the reputation of the claimant. The 1st defendant submitted that the plaint does not mention the words that were defamatory which were spoken by the 1st defendant. The Plaintiff only alleges that the 1st Defendant procured the 4th, 5th, and 6th Defendants to publish defamatory words. That is not an element of uttering a word as is contemplated by the court in of Joseph Njogu Kamunge v Charles Muriuki Gachari [2016] eKLR■",court,52.50%,model
"The 1st defendant submitted the Plaint has not specifically disclosed how the alleged publications have undermined the reputation of the Plaintiffs in the eyes of the right-thinking members of the society. Having fallen short of this element, the Plaint does not sustain a defamation suit let alone against the 1st Defendant.
The 1st defendant submitted further that the matter is barred by limitation of time. The cause of action of the Plaintiffs against the 1st Defendant has no chance of success because the suit was instituted on 11/6/2018. It is based on the alleged invalidity of caveats which were removed by the Registrar on Chief Land Registrar on the 25/5/2012 and the Nairobi Civil Application No. 198 of 2013 which was filed in 2013.
The 1st defendant argued that he is a mere citizen of Kenya and has no control or influence over the journalists that work for the Business Daily or the Nation Newspapers. The 1st Defendant is not a publisher or a proprietor of any newspaper making media house as alleged by the Plaintiffs at paragraph 11 of the Plaint. Neither is the 1st Defendant an employee of any publishing company within or without Kenya. No particulars of any statement uttered by the 1st Defendant have been alleged in the Plaint.
The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs submitted that law is very clear and categorical on the nature of an Application seeking to strike out a suit and the threshold that must be met. Under Order 2, Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, provides:
""(1) At any stage of the proceedings the court may order to be struck out or amended any pleading on the ground that-
a. it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence in law; or■ 
b. it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or
c. it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or
d. it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court,
and may order the suit to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.
(2) No evidence shall be admissible on an application under sub rule (1) (a) but the application shall state concisely the grounds on which it is made.""",court,55.59%,model
"The plaintiffs submitted the application herein disregards Order 2, Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules, the 1st Defendant's submissions contain material evidence which should not form the substance of an application for striking out. The Application filed by the 1st Defendant are mere side shows aimed at distracting the Court from the real issues before it for determination.
It is trite law that summary procedure is a radical remedy and a court of law should be slow in resorting to this procedure which can only be applicable in plain, clear and obvious cases. Madan J (as he then was) in D T Dobie & Company (Kenya) Limited v Muchina,[1982]KLR 1,at page 9,said:
“The Court ought to act very cautiously and carefully and consider all facts of the case without embarking upon a trial thereof before dismissing a case for not disclosing a reasonable cause of action or being otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court. At this stage the Court ought not to deal with any merits of the case for that is a function solely reserved for the judge at the trial as the Court itself is not usually fully informed so as to deal with the merits without discovery, without oral discovery tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way.”
A pleading ought to be struck out if it is shown to be completely bad to the extent that not even an amendment can save it. The Court of Appeal in Francis Kamande v Vanguard Electrical Services Limited, Civil Appeal Number 152 of 1996, [1998] eKLR, observed that the summary procedure can only be adopted when it can be clearly seen that a claim or answer is on the face of it “obviously unsustainable.”
The plaintiffs further submitted that the Plaint filed on the 11/6/2018 is not barred by the Statute of Limitations Act as it is not a defamatory suit as alleged to be by the 1st Defendant a clear indication, he has not properly understood the suit filed herein or feigns ignorance by alleging that this is a defamatory suit. The 1st Defendant is well aware that the issues raised in Plaint relate to the conduct of the 1st Defendant that has caused great financial loss to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff which he cannot use this court to escape from the same.
The issues for determination in this application are as follows;",court,56.07%,model
"The issues for determination in this application are as follows;
Whether this suit discloses a cause of action against the 1st and 2nd defendants.
Whether the plaintiff’s suit is statute time barred.
Whether the plaintiff’s suit against the 1st and 2nd defendants should be struck out.
On the issue as to whether the suit discloses a cause of action against the 1st and 2nd defendants, I find that this is not an issue that can be determined at interlocutory stage.
There is need for a full hearing for the court to determine the said issue.
On the issue as to whether the plaintiff’s suit is statute time barred again the issue needs ventilation by adducing evidence to determine when the cause of action arose.
On the issue as to whether the plaintiff’s suit against the 1st and 2nd defendants should be struck out, I find that striking out of the suit would be a draconian step.
The duty of the court is to preserve pleadings no matter how hopeless. In Yaya Towers Limited v Trade Bank Limited (In Liquidation) (Civil Appeal No. 35 of 2000) the same court expressed itself thus:
“A plaintiff (defendant) is entitled to pursue a claim in our courts however implausible and however improbable his chances of success. Unless the defendant (plaintiff) can demonstrate shortly and conclusively that the plaintiff’s claim is bound to fail or is otherwise objectionable as an abuse of the process of the Court, it must be allowed to proceed to trial...It cannot be doubted that the Court has inherent jurisdiction to dismiss that, which is an abuse of the process of the Court. It is a jurisdiction, which ought to be sparingly exercised and only in exceptional cases, and its exercise would not be justified merely because the story told in the pleadings was highly improbable, and one, which was difficult to believe, could be proved.”
The application dated 6/12/2018 lacks in merit and the same is dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs.

ELRC CAUSE NO. 1106 OF 2018
PITALIS MUSITIKHO ANDUKA■CLAIMANT 
- VERSUS -
ROSOLO BUILDING CO. LIMITED ■………….RESPONDENT
(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the Statement of claim on 02.07.2018 through Wanyonyi & Muhia Advocates. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
The sum of Kshs.2,769,237.44.
Cost of this suit.
Interests on (a) and (b) above at Court rates. 
Any other relief that this Honourable Court may deem just. 
The Statement of response was filed on 23.08.2018 through Oyatta & Associates Advocates. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant’s case was that he was employed by the respondent on or about January 2000, as a carpenter, and that he served the respondent with loyalty and diligence until 06.05.2017, when, without any lawful cause, the respondent terminated his services. 
The claimant states that the respondent breached the terms of employment by failing to confirm him as an employee having served it for 17 years as a casual labourer.
It is the claimant’s case that the respondent failed to pay him just wages in accordance with the minimum wages’ regulations by paying him Kshs.700/= per day instead of the stipulated wages of Kshs.1,062.65 per day. 
The claimant pleaded that the respondent unlawfully denied him annual leave and forced him to work seven days a week without overtime allowances.  
That he was on 03.05.2016 injured in the course of his employment and was subsequently compensated by the insurance company for the injuries at the sum of Kshs.859,200/= which was paid through the respondent. The claimant states that the respondent unlawfully withheld the compensation from him and his attempts to recover the said sum from the respondent led to his services being unlawfully terminated.",court,53.91%,model
"On the part of the respondents it is stated that the claimant was never its employee, but was instead a causal labourer who would be occasionally called upon to work for it whenever need arose. 
The respondent asserts that it was non-existent and had not been incorporated in the year 2000, and, that it only came into existence when it was registered in 2005. Therefore, the claimant could not have been its employee as claimed. 
The respondent states that it only required the services of the claimant in 2013 and in 2015, for a period of 3 weeks on both occasions, with the claimant being injured during the latter period while undertaking carpentry services for it. 
That during the said two periods, the claimant was fully remunerated upon completion of the carpentry tasks given. 
That on 04.06.2015 while the claimant was engaged by the respondent, he got injured and incurred medical expenses amounting to Kshs.62,319/= which expenses were subsequently compensated by the respondent through its insurance company for a sum of Kshs.81,915/=. That the work injury benefits claim is an entirely different cause of action and cannot therefore be brought under this suit. 
The Claimant testified by adopting his witness statement and final submissions were filed for him. The respondent, despite service, failed to avail the witness and no final submissions were filed in that regard. The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
The claimant has pleaded and testified that he served as a casual employee over a period of 17 years. The Court finds that by his own pleading and testimony per paragraph 2 of the witness statement, he was a casual employee, on and off. 
He enumerated his claims as follows:
Unpaid salary difference from 01.08.2013 – 30.05.2017 being 44 months thus 362.65 salary difference x1338.30.
One-month salary in lieu of notice Kshs.31, 879.50.
Salary from 01.05.2017 to 06.05.2017 Kshs.5, 313.25.
Unpaid leave for 17 years Kshs.541,951.50.
A year’s salary compensation for unlawful termination Kshs.382, 554.00.",court,52.29%,model
"A year’s salary compensation for unlawful termination Kshs.382, 554.00.
Gratuity for 16 years 5 months Kshs.210, 404.70.
Injury compensation paid by Monarch Insurance Kshs.859,200.00.
Unpaid NSSF for 17-years Kshs.400 x 198 months = Kshs.79, 200.00.
Unpaid NHIF for 17 years Kshs.173, 400.00.
Total claim Kshs.2, 769,237.44.
The Court has considered the material on record. The Court returns that the claimant has asserted that he was a casual employee. How then could the Court award him claims as prayed based on monthly rates of payment? The Court finds the reliefs as claimed for are speculative and not established at all. It cannot be that the underpayment was for all 17 years and that the same rate of payment applied and which is not shown to have been the case. 
As relates to compensation for injuries suffered, counsel for the claimant surrendered the same on 26.07.2023 per orders on record.
If the relationship was casual, then how would the Court return that it was an unfair termination whereas the witness statement states that the termination was without notice on unspecified date. The date, in the statement of claim and in the witness’ statement was 03.05.2016 when the claimant suffered the injury. The date of the alleged termination is at large. The Court is unable to return a finding of unfair termination for want of due circumstances and particulars duly establishing the alleged unfair termination.
In conclusion judgment is hereby entered for dismissal of the suit with orders each party to bear own costs of the suit.

The application coming for consideration is the one dated 17/4/2023 brought under Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure rules 2010, Section 1A, 1B, 3 and 3A of the Civil Procedure Act Cap 21 Laws of Kenya seeking the following orders;
THAT this application be certified as urgent and be heard urgently in the first instance.
THAT there be a stay of execution of the judgment and decree made herein on the 28th day March 2023 until the application herein is heard and determined.
THAT there be a temporary stay of execution of the judgment and decree made herein on the 28th day of March 2023 until the appeal preferred to the court of appeal is heard and determined.
THAT the judgment and decree be interpreted by this honourable court for determination of the rights of the defendants and the rest of the committee members of Muungano Slaughter House Women Society.
THAT the honourable court give directions on the status quo.
THAT costs of this application be in the cause.
The application is premised on the following grounds;
THAT judgment was read on 28th of March 2023.
THAT the defendant being dissatisfied with the said judgment have preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
THAT the defendants applied for a certified copy of the proceedings, judgment and decree on or about the 13th of April, 2023 for purposes of appeal.
THAT the 2nd plaintiff with other people who are not party to this suit have invaded the slaughterhouse and have started running the same.",court,57.01%,model
"THAT such invasion is confrontational and is likely to cause mayhem and public disorder.
THAT unless properly interpreted such action might lead to bloodshed
The application is supported by the affidavit of MARY WAMBUI MBUGUA sworn on 17/4/2023 in which she deposed that being dissatisfied with the judgement and decree of the court the defendants have preferred an appeal to the court of appeal. She has applied and paid a deposit for certified copies of the proceedings judgement and decree in this matter.
On or about 6/4/2023 the 2nd plaintiff in the company of Veronia Munee, Mumina Bubicha, Joan Wangui Peter, Mary Muthoni and Amina Abdulla invaded the slaughter house belonging to Muungano Women Society and started running the affairs of the society without the decree of the court. Nothing in the judgement indicated that the 2nd defendant was to take over the running of the society without an election.
The respondents filed a replying affidavit sworn by WEDDY NJERI GITAU on 19/6/2023 opposing the application dated 17/4/2023. It is deposed that upon delivery of judgement this court became functus officio. That further the persons named in the affidavit by Mary Wambui were not in the initial suit and bear no correlation with the suit at hand. It is therefore imperative that should the defendant wish to enjoin them in the suit for the purposes of them responding, then she should file a fresh suit.
THAT the learned judge issued a declaration that reads ""That a Declaration is hereby issued that the Defendants have run down the affairs of the Society in Contravention with the Societies Constitution.” Read together with Order vi issued in the Decree, the Defendant was supposed to convene an all-inclusive special General Meeting under the supervision of the Registrar of Societies. She failed to convene the same opting to rush back to court seeking stay orders. The Judge in his wisdom noted that indeed the affairs of the society were not in good hands. It was imperative to form a committee to oversee the affairs of the Society post-judgment since the Defendant was non-committal on the same.",court,55.41%,model
"Having failed to convene a General Meeting as ordered by the court, the prerogative was bestowed on her to convene the General Meeting in accordance with the law. The Registrar of Societies, having been satisfied that the issuance of notices and documents was proper, issued a letter dated 16/5/2023 wherein she approved our request to have the Special General Meeting and equally assigned officers from her office to assist in overseeing the process pursuant to the Court Orders.
The parties filed written submissions in the application as follows; the defendant/applicant submitted that they have complied with Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules and filed a Notice of Appeal on 12/4/2023 and served the same on the plaintiff’s advocates.
The defendants argued that the 2nd Plaintiff together with others invaded the slaughter house without a court order and took over the running of the society without first being elected in the general meeting as ordered by the court. There is no order in the judgement that give the 2nd plaintiff to take over the running of the society or to reinstate her to the position she had as secretary of the society. The court could have declared itself as clearly as it has on the other points.
The plaintiff/respondent submitted that the defendant/ applicant herein has not stated what substantial loss they are likely to suffer if their application is not granted. That in weighing whether to grant stay of execution pending appeal, the court must balance the rights of the Appellant as well as those of the respondent. The Applicant herein has mismanaged the affairs of the Society to the brink of collapse while almost selling off the society’s property. This has already been determined by the court.  Having failed to satisfy the principles for grant of stay of execution orders, the application should be dismissed.
The issues for determination in this application are as follows;
Whether the applicants are entitled to stay of execution pending appeal.
Whether the judgment delivered on 28/3/2023 should be interpreted for the determination of the rights of the defendants and the rest of the members of Muungano Slaughter House Women Society.
On the issue as to whether stay of execution should be granted pending the hearing and determination of the appeal, the governing principles for stay pending appeal is Order 42 Rule 6 which states as follows;",court,56.46%,model
"“(1) No appeal or second appeal shall operate as a stay of execution or proceedings under a decree or order appealed from except appeal case of in so far as the court appealed from may order but, the court appealed from may for sufficient cause order stay of execution of such decree or order, and whether the application for such stay shall have been granted or refused by the court appealed from, the court to which such appeal is preferred shall be at liberty, on application being made, to consider such application and to make such order thereon as may to it seem just, and any person aggrieved by an order of stay made by the court from whose decision the appeal is preferred may apply to the appellate court to have such order set aside.
(2) No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—
(a) the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the Applicants unless the order is made, and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
(b) such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the Applicants”.
I find that the court gave declaratory orders which cannot be stayed. The court in its judgment dated 28th March 2023 gave the following declaratory orders:
“i.■A declaration be and is hereby issued that the defendants have run the affairs of the society in contravention of the society’s constitution.
ii.■A declaration be and is hereby issued that the special delegates meeting of the society held on 5th September 2012 was unlawful as it was held in contravention of the society’s constitution.
iii.■A declaration be and is hereby issued that all and/or any resolutions of the special delegates meeting of the society held on 5th September 2012, including the resolution to sell the society’s plot, are null and void.
iv.■An injunction be and is hereby issued restraining the defendants jointly and/or severally by themselves, their servants, employees, agents and/or through trustees of the society or otherwise howsoever, from selling, transferring, alienating, disposing or in any other way whatsoever parting with ownership and possession of all that parcel of land known as Title No.220/3 PT (UNS.Plot No. ‘B’).",court,56.32%,model
"v.■An order be and is hereby issued requiring the defendants to give a true and just account of the society’s income.
vi.■An order be and is hereby issued compelling the defendants to convene an all-inclusive special general meeting of the society as directed by the Deputy Registrar of Societies vide his letter dated 10th May 2012 under the supervision and coordination of the Registrar of Societies.
vii.■The defendants shall pay the 2nd plaintiff’s costs of the suit.■
viii.■The 1st plaintiff’s suit abated while the 3rd plaintiff’s suit is hereby dismissed with costs.
It is so ordered.”
On the issue as to whether the judgment and decree of this court should be interpreted, I find that the judgment is very clear that the Defendants were required to convene an all-inclusive special general meeting of the society as directed by the Deputy Registrar of Societies vide his letter dated 10th May 2012 under the supervision and coordination of the Registrar of Societies. 
I find that the parties are duty bound to comply with the orders of the court.
 Since the declaratory orders cannot be stayed, the plaintiffs are directed to enjoin the Registrar of Societies for purposes of enforcement of the judgment of this court dated 28th March 2023.      
However, in view of the objection raised by the Defendant/Applicants that this his case is pending appeal, I direct that the parties proceed to the Court of appeal.
 This court is therefore functus official and I find that the Application dated 17/4/2023 lacks in merit and the same is dismissed with costs to the Respondents.

                                                    RULING 
The defendants filed a notice of motion, dated 5th May 2021 seeking to set aside the ex parte Judgment entered on 25/7/2019 and leave to defend.
The application is premised on grounds that although the defendants entered appearance and filed a defence, they did not attend court for the hearing on 18th June 2019 because they were not aware of the hearing date.
According to the defendants, their advocates then on record (M/s Kyalo Mwengi & Co. Advocate) did not notify them of the hearing date and as a result they did not attend court. The defendants stated that as at 23rd October 2014 their advocates’ offices were still based at View Park Towers, Utalii Street and only relocated to Hughes Building on Muindi Mbingu Street in November 2018.
 The defendants asserted that due to their advocates’ mistake, judgment was entered against them and they faced the risk of execution as the respondents had instructed auctioneers to execute the decree issued against them for Euros 651,943.56.
The defendants argued that the judgment obtained against them was irregular and should be set aside. They also argued that notice of entry of judgment was not served on them to afford them an opportunity to appeal or apply for review of that judgment.
The defendant further stated that the application had been brought without undue delay and that the plaintiff would not suffer prejudice if the application was allowed. They however stood to suffer great prejudice if the judgment was not set aside and execution was allowed to proceed.",court,54.76%,model
"The defendants called for aid, article 159(2) (a) and (d) of the Constitution and sections 1A (1) and 1B (1) (a) of the Civil Procedure Act that regardless of the technicalities, it is just for the Court to allow their application so that they are not condemned unheard. 
The defendants faulted the plaintiff for failing to disclose to Court that they [defendants] had filed a suit (HCCC No. 824 of 2010) before the same court, between the same parties and over the same claims. 
The defendants took the view, that there was no basis for the plaintiff’s contention that there is conflict of interest since Mr. Robert Asembo did not represent the plaintiff in a bribery case or cyber-crime criminal case.
The defendants relied on Order 10 rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules that the court may set a side or vary judgment and any consequential orders on terms that are just. The defendants again relied on the Patel v E A Cargo Handling Services Ltd [1974] E A 75 that there are no limits or restrictions on the judge’s discretion to set aside or vary an exparte judgment.
The defendants again relied on Shah v Mbogo [1967] E A 166 that the discretion to set aside an exparte judgment is intended to be exercised so that to avoid injustice or hardship.
The defendants further cited the decision in Mungai v Gachuhi & another [2005] eKLR that a decision is final only when a proper hearing has taken place.
Response
The plaintiff opposed the application through a replying affidavit and written submissions. The plaintiff stated that despite efforts to have the suit heard expeditiously, the defendants’ advocates were unavailable for the fixing of hearing dates. When they failed to appear, his advocates served them with Hearing Notices and filed affidavits of service. He continuously followed up the case and travelled from Germany to attend the hearings but the case never took off. 
The plaintiff’s advocates raised concerns with the court that the suit was taking too long to conclude and the defendants’ advocates were again invited to fix a hearing date but did not attend. They were served with a hearing notice and an affidavit of service was filed.",court,55.69%,model
"On the hearing date, neither the defendants nor their advocates attended court. The case proceeded to hearing and on 25th July 2019 the court delivered judgment allowing the suit. 
The plaintiff contended that the defendants filed this application on 5th May 2021, more than one year and eight months after the judgment had been delivered an inordinate delay. The plaintiff also faulted the defendants for failing to inform the Court of the status of HCCC No. 824 of 2010 they said they had filed. 
The plaintiff argued that the firm of M/s Asembo & Co. Advocates having previously represented him, was improperly on record due to conflict of interest. Their Entering into the matter without leave or consent of the defendants’ previous advocates was also irregular and against Order 9 rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules.
The plaintiff asserted that the judgment is regular and he should be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the judgment. He relied on Order 12 rules 2(a) and 7 of the Rules that he was entitled to proceed with the hearing ex parte since the defendants had been served with a hearing notice. 
The plaintiff also relied on the decision in Josphat Nderitu Kariuki v Pine Breeze Hospital Ltd (Civil Suit 223 of 2005) [2006] eKLR that the defendants had not given sufficient explanation for their failure to attend court. Their advocates should thus bear the consequences of their professional negligence for failure to attend court on behalf of their clients.
The defendant again relied on Lucy Bosire v Nyankoni Manga (ELC 211 of 2009) [2016] eKLR, that it was the defendants’ responsibility to follow up their case. They cannot lay the blame on their previous advocates.
 Reliance was further placed on Josphat Muthui Muli (Industrial Cause No. 1224 of 2012) [2014] eKLR, that the court’s discretion to set aside an ex parte judgment is intended to be exercised to avoid injustice or hardship resulting from accident, inadvertence, or excusable mistake or error, but not to assist a person who has deliberately sought (whether by evasion or otherwise) to obstruct or delay the cause of justice.",court,56.81%,model
"The plaintiff cited brahim Mungara Mwangi v Francis Ndegwa Mwangi [2014] eKLR and Water Parnters International v Benjamin K’oyoo T/A Group of Women in Agriculture – Kochieng (Gwako) Ministries (Civil Case No. 105 of 2010) [2014] eKLR, that the application had been brought after an inordinate delay.
The plaintiff further cited Jackline Wakesho v Aroma Café (Cause No. 212 of 2013) [2014] eKLR that the defendants’ non-compliance with Order 9 rule 9 rendered the proceedings incompetent.
Determination
I have considered the application, the response and arguments by parties. I have also considered the decisions relied on in support of the parties’ respective positions.
The defendants’ reason for seeking to set aside the exparte judgment is that they were not aware of the hearing date. According to the defendants, their then advocates M/s Kyalo Mwengi & Co. Advocate did not inform them of the hearing date. That was the reason why they failed to attend court.
The defendants also argued that their advocates’ mistake caused the plaintiff to obtain judgment and decree against them for Euros 651,943.56 which was irregular and should be set aside so that they can have their day in court. The defendants again argued that notice of entry of judgment was not served on them as required by the rules.
Whether the judgment is irregular
The defendants’ argument is that the judgment entered against them is irregular and should be set aside ex debito justitiae: as a matter of right.
Whether a judgment is regular or irregular is a matter of fact to be determined from the circumstances of the case. The Court of Appeal has addressed the distinction between a regular and irregular judgment in several decisions.
In James Kanyita Nderitu V Maries Philotas Ghika & Another [2016] eKLR, the Court stated that:",court,54.96%,model
"In a regular default judgment, the defendant will have been duly served with summons to enter appearance, but for one reason or another, he had failed to enter appearances or to file defence, resulting in default judgment. Such a defendant is entitled, under Order 10 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules, to move the court to set aside the default judgment and to grant him leave to defend the suit. In such a scenario, the court has unfettered discretion in determining whether or not to set aside the default judgment, and will take into account such as the reason for the failure of the defendant to file his Memorandum of appearance or defence, as the case may be, the length of time that has elapsed since the default judgment was entered; whether the intended defence raises triable issues; the respective prejudice such party is likely to suffer.
The court then stated regarding an irregular judgment that:
[J]udgment will have been entered against a defendant who has not been served or properly served with summons to enter appearance. In such a situation, the default judgment is set aside ex debito justitiae, as a matter of right. The court does not even have to be moved by a party once it comes to its notice that the judgment is irregular, it can set aside the default judgment on its own motion. In addition, the court will not venture into considerations of whether the intended defence raises triable issue. Or whether there has been inordinate delay in applying to set aside the irregular judgment. The reason why such judgment is set aside as of right, and not as a matter of discretion, is because the party against whom it is entered has been condemned without notice of the allegations against him or an opportunity to be heard in response to those allegations. The right to be heard before an adverse decision is taken against a person is fundamental and permeates our entire justice system. 
In Bouchard International (Services) Ltd v M’mwereria [1987] KLR 193, the Court of Appeal held that:",court,56.93%,model
"The basis of approach in Kenya to the exercise of the discretion to be employed or rejected under either Rule 8 or Rule 10 (the latter dealing with judgement by default) is that if service of summons to enter appearance has not been effected, the lack of an initiating process will cause the steps taken to set aside ex debito justitiae. If service of notice of hearing or summons to enter appearance has been served, then the court will have before it a regular judgement which may yet be set aside or varied on just terms. To exercise this discretion is a statutory duty and the exercise must be judicial… 
The Court went on to state that:
A judge has to judge the matter in the light of all the facts and circumstances both prior and subsequent and of the respective merits of the parties before it would be just and reasonable to set aside or vary the judgement, if necessary, upon terms to be imposed. 
The decisions are clear that in a regular judgment, a defendant will have been properly served but for some reason, he failed to enter appearance of file a defence.  In such a case, the court still has wide discretion to set aside the judgment on terms that are just.
An irregular judgment will have been obtained without service or proper service on the defendant. Such a judgment will be set aside as a matter of right and the defendant granted unconditional leave to defend.
I have perused the record in this matter. The suit was filed on 14th July 2011 but did not take off until 18th June 2019. On that day, the plaintiff was present in court but the defendants and their advocate were not. The suit proceeded to hearing and judgment was delivered on 25th July 2019, which the defendants argue was irregular.
Order 12 rule 2 of the rules provides that if on the day fixed for hearing, after the suit has been called out for hearing outside the court, only the plaintiff attends, and if the court is satisfied that notice of hearing was duly served, it may proceed ex parte.
On 18th June 2019 when the suit came up for hearing, the court was informed that the defendants’ advocates had been served and upon satisfying itself of the service, the court proceeded to hear the suit.",court,57.74%,model
"The record shows that the defendants had been served with summons, entered appearance and filed a defence. Their advocate was also served with a hearing notice but both the defendants and their advocate failed to attend court for the hearing of the case. Failure to attend court, though served, did not make the judgment resulting from the exparte hearing irregular. It is therefore this court’s finding that the judgment entered against the defendants was a regular judgment.
Whether to set aside
The next issue is whether to set aside the exparte judgment. The court having determined that the judgment was regular, whether or not to set aside the judgment is an exercise of discretion which should be done on terms that are just. That is; this discretion like all other discretions, must be exercised judiciously.
40.In Shanzu Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Lands [1993] eKLR, the court delivered itself thus: 
The jurisdiction to vary judgment being a judicial discretion should be exercised judicially; and, as is often said, whether judicial discretion should be exercised or withheld in a party’s favour, depends, on a large measure, on the facts of each particular case. The tests for the exercise of this discretion are these: - First, was there a defense on the merits? Secondly, would there be any prejudice? Thirdly, what was the explanation for any delay.
In Shabir Din v Ram Parkash Anand (1955) 22 EACA 48 Briggs JA stated at page 51: 
I consider that under Order IX rule 20, the discretion of the court is perfectly free, and the only question is whether upon the facts of any particular case it should be exercised. In particular, mistake or misunderstanding of the appellant's legal advisers, even though negligent, may be accepted as a proper ground for granting relief, but whether it will be so accepted must depend on the facts of the particular case. It is neither possible nor desirable to indicate in detail the manner in which the discretion should be exercised.
In Yooshin Engineering Corporation v Aia Architects Limited (Civil Appeal E074 of 2022) [2023] KECA 872 (KLR) (7 July 2023) (Judgment), the Court of Appeal reiterated that:",court,56.61%,model
"[E]ven where the judgement is regular, the court still retains the wide discretion to set the same aside though if the Court decides to set aside the judgement, depending on the circumstances, it may do so on conditions that are just. That discretion, being wide, the main concern is for the court to do justice to the parties, and in so doing the court will not impose conditions on itself to fetter the wide discretion given to it by the rules. It has however to ask itself under what conditions, if any, it ought to set aside the judgement and such conditions, if appropriate, must be just to both the Plaintiff and the Defendant.
The decisions affirm that the discretion of the court to set aside a regular exparte judgment is wide but the discretion must be exercised judicious and any conditions to be imposed must be just to both parties, the plaintiff and the defendant.
I have gone through the record which shows that although judgment was entered on 25th July 2019, this application was only filed in May 2021, almost two years after the suit had been heard. The defendants, apart from stating that they were not informed of the hearing date, did not attempt to explain why they made no effort to find out from their advocates the status of their case. In other words, the defendants did not explain the delay in filing the application to set aside the judgment.
Even though the defendants again stated that their advocates then on record had not moved office when some letter was sent to them, that argument would not be relevant in this application. The issue here is why the defendants did not attend court and whether the exparte judgment should be set aside.
As already alluded to, this court’ discretion to set aside a regular exparte judgment though wide, must be exercised judiciously and for good reason. In this regard, it was the defendants’ duty to show that the circumstances they were relying on to seek to set aside the judgment were persuasive and that their failure to attend court was excusable.",court,57.30%,model
"I have perused the affidavit of service by Benson Mutinda sworn on 12th June 2019. The process server served a hearing notice on the defendant’s Advocates which was received and stamped. The defendants did not explain why they did not take steps to find out from their advocates the status of their case even if the advocates had not informed them of the hearing date. The defendants only woke up after the plaintiff moved to execute the judgment almost two years after the case had been heard, to persuade the court to exercise its discretion in their favour.
Regarding the defendants’ argument that notice of entry of judgment was not served, the defendants must have had in mind Order 22 rule 6 which states that where judgment in “default of appearance or defence” has been entered against a defendant, no execution by payment, attachment or eviction should issue unless not a notice of not than ten days notice of the entry of judgment has been served on him personally, and a copy of that notice is filed with the first application for execution.
It is plain from the rule that the notice is to be served where judgment is entered in default of appearance or defence. The rational for requiring service of a notice is to make the defendant aware of entry of judgment against him and the impending execution so that to obviate being taken by surprise. The defendant may take steps to challenge the default judgment in the event he disputes service of summons or even opt to pay to avert the impending execution.
Where appearance was however entered and a defence filed, like in this case, execution of the judgment entered after the exparte hearing of the case, (in the absence of the defendant), does not require service of the notice for entry of such judgment.
Flowing from my analysis above and after a careful consideration of the application, arguments by parties and on perusing the defence, the conclusion I come to is that the defendants have not satisfied this Court that they deserve this court’s discretion to set aside the regular exparte judgment entered against them.
I have perused the defence and, in my view, the defence is a mere denial that does not raise triable issues to call for leave to defend. The contention that there was another suit between the same parties over the same issue would not be a ground for setting aside a regular judgment since the defendants did not disclose to this Court what became of that suit.",court,57.80%,model
"Taking into account all the circumstances surrounding this case, I find this application unmeritorious. Consequently, the application is declined and dismissed with costs.

(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the memorandum of claim on 06.09.2018. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
Reinstatement of the grievant unconditionally 
Damages for loss of earning from the date of termination up to date. 
Costs of the suit in favour of the claimant 
In the alternative and where the reinstatement shall not be the best remedy, the claimant prays that the grievant to be paid the following as his terminal benefits to be based with the London distillers CBA which the grievant has 
The statement of response and counterclaim was filed on 07.11.2018 through Gichina Macharia Matotse Advocates. The respondent counter-claimed and prayed for:
The claim to be dismissed with costs. 
The claimant be condemned to pay damages in the tune of Kshs.1,000,000/= for breach of sound industrial relations. 
A declaration that the termination of William Nyakundi was fair and lawful. 
Any other relief the court deems fit. 
The claimant’s case was that its member, William Nyakundi Makori was employed by the respondent on 23.04.2012 as a general worker, at a starting salary of Kshs.7,586 per month. 
That his terms and conditions of employment were based on the CBA of London Distillers, the mother company of the respondent. 
On 29.09.2016 the employee was issued with a termination letter. However, following the intervention of the claimant, the employee was reinstated on 03.10.2016.",court,52.21%,model
"The letter of reinstatement, indicated that the same would serve as a first warning. Subsequently on 05.11.2016, the employee was issued with another termination letter. However, the respondent had miscalculated his dues. 
The termination letter referred to an issue that was resolved in June 2016. Aggrieved, the employee reported the matter to the claimant, who took up the matter and referred the same to conciliation. 
It is the claimant’s case that the employee and itself, attended all conciliation meetings. The respondent failed to attend the same. 
The claimant’s case is that the termination of the employee’s employment was due to his membership with the claimant. 
It is stated that the respondent refused to issue the employee with a certificate of service and this has caused him difficulty in trying to secure another job. 
On the part of the respondent it is argued that the respondent is a privately-owned farm and residence of one, Mohan Galot his family and that the employee, William Nyakundi, was employed to work at the residence, located in Kiambu. 
The respondent’s case is that it does not have a recognition agreement or a CBA with the claimant. The duties of the employee have never been transferred to or reallocated to any entity, during the pendency of his employment. That the activities undertaken at the respondent estate fall outside the jurisdiction of the CBA, and that the respondent have never remitted union and COTU dues with regards to the employee. 
The respondent states that the employee has never been the claimant’s union member and that the claimant has no legal standing to bring the claim on behalf of the employee. 
The respondent pleaded that the employee was fairly and lawfully terminated and his terminal dues were computed in line with the employment law. 
The res
The parties filed their respective submissions. The court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.",court,52.08%,model
"The 1st issue is whether the grievant William Nyakundi Marori was a member of the claimant trade union. The claimant has pleaded that there is no recognition or collective agreements between the parties. The claimant has pleaded that by its registered constitution, it represents employees in real estate enterprises which the respondent is engaged in.  There is no pleading that the grievant is a member of the union. While there is no recognition, the recognition dispute is before conciliator but the employees of the respondent have been benefiting from the collective agreement in place. The letter of appointment is dated 19.04.2012. It does not refer or incorporate the collective agreement as alleged for the claimant trade union. As submitted for the respondent, the claimant has not shown that grievant for whose benefit the suit was filed was its member. The Court and the Court of appeal have settled that membership is to representation by union whereas collective bargaining is to recognition. Thus, a union cannot institute a suit for or represent a union if the employee said to be aggrieved has not been shown to be a member of the trade union. Even if recognition agreement had not been concluded between the parties, it was important to show that the grievant was a member of the union. The Court finds that the claimant failed to show that important precondition for justifying moving the Court the way it was done. The suit will fail for want of the grievant being a member of the claimant trade union. Confirming doubt about his membership in the union, the grievant testified thus, “I have filed a document to show I was a member of union. I paid union dues. I say no document on record to show I belonged to the union.”
The statement of claim shows that the claims and prayers were based on a collective agreement that has not been shown to bind the parties. The claimant not being a member of the trade union and there being no binding collective agreement, there is no way the terms in the collective agreement could become incorporated in the claimant’s contract of service. The claimant’s suit will fail.
It is pleaded and submitted for the respondent that it is not a person in law and in view of that position, the counterclaim would as well collapse without more to it. The point being that a no person in law cannot claim and obtain remedies in a Court of law. The Court finds accordingly. There will be no orders on costs.",court,53.43%,model
"In conclusion the statement of claim and the counterclaim are dismissed with no orders in costs.

"Parties filed and exchanged written submissions. 
Mr Murunga, learned counsel for the 1st petitioner/protestor raised two issues for determination namely whether Samuel Wanjala Wekesa, Violet Nanjala Wekesa, Titus Nabukhamba and Patrick Wanyonyi are children of the deceased and/or dependents and whether the court should adopt the mode of distribution as proposed in the application. It was submitted that the said persons should not inherit the estate of the deceased as they are not biological children of the deceased. It was submitted that the said persons have their own biological fathers and that they have already been provided accordingly by their families. Learned counsel further submitted that there was no proof of dependency by the aforesaid persons who are for all intents and purposes strangers to the estate. To allow them to inherit the estate will cause great prejudice to the petitioners herein who should be left to inherit the estate of the deceased as proposed by the 1st petitioner.  Reliance was placed in section 29 of the Law of Succession Act and the case of Re Estate of Jedida Wambui Njoroge (deceased) Succession Cause 541 of 2014 [2022] KLR.
Mr Onyando for the 2nd and 3rd petitioners submitted that the proposed mode of distribution by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners should be accepted since all the beneficiaries except the 1st petitioner have duly signed the consent to distribution. It was submitted that the protestor failed to prove that the other beneficiaries were not dependent on the deceased prior to his death. Reliance was placed in section 3(2) and 29 of the Law of Succession Act. It was pointed out that the 1st petitioner in his evidence confirmed that the 2nd petitioner had come with her young children when she got married to the deceased and that the deceased took them in as his own children even as he sired the 1st petitioner and the 3rd petitioner. Learned counsel sought for the dismissal of the protest and that the grant be confirmed in accordance with the proposed mode of distribution by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners.
                     Analysis and Determination",court,55.80%,model
"Analysis and Determination 
I have given due consideration  to the rival evidence of the 1st petitioner/protestor and the 2nd, 3rd petitioners as well as the submissions of their respective learned counsels. It is not in dispute that the 2nd petitioner was married to the deceased after the deceased’s first wife died. It is also not in doubt that the said 2nd petitioner at the time of the marriage came along with her young childfren whom the deceased took in as his children. It is also not in dispute that the deceased and the 2nd petitioner were blessed with two biological children namely the 1st  and 3rd petitioners herein. It is also not in dispute that the 2nd petitioner had earlier been married to one Pinika  Kitui Namachanja and that upon his demise, she got married to the deceased herein. I find the two issues foe determination are firstly, whther the 2nd petitioner and her children born out of wedlock including the one introduced by the deceased namely Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa are dependants of the deceased and entitled to inherit his estate and secondly; which mode of distribution of the estate is suitable in the circumstances?
As regards the first issue, it is necessary to fall back on the Law of Succession Act as regards the question of who is a dependant. Section 29 of the Act provides:
‘’(a)         the wife or wives, or former wife, or wives, and the children of                               the deceased whether or not maintained by the deceased immediately prior to his death;
such of the deceased’s parents, step-parents, grandchildren, step-grandchildren, children whom the deceased had taken into his familyas his own, brothers and sisters, and half-brothers and half-sisters, as were being maintained by the deceased immediately prior to his death; and
( c) where the deceased was a woman, her husband if he was being maintained by her immediately prior to the date of her death.’’",court,54.94%,model
"It transpired from the evidence that the 2nd petitioner at the time of her marriage to the deceased she came along with three children namely Samuel Wanjala, Titus Nabukhamba and Vilolet Nanjala who were then still young and that the deceased took them in as his own and maintained them. The deceased and the 2nd petitioner were subsequently blessed with two children namely Joseph Wamalwa Wekesa and Ann Kisaka Otieno. The evidence of the 3rd petitioner Ann Kisaka Otieno is that she is the first born biological child of the deceased and the 2nd petitioner and who stated that she grew up together with her brothers Titus Nabukhamba, Samuel Wanjala, Joseph Wamalwa as well as Violet Nanjala. She also testified that the deceased later introduced to the family Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa as one of his sons through Bahengele clan ceremony regarding children sired out of wedlock. She added that her father later organized for her brothers’ circumcision and that he later collected dowry during the marriage of Violet Nanjala. It was her evidence that the 1st petitioner has ganged up with the clan to disinherit her and the rest of the family. She vouched for the mode of distribution presented by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners. Her sentiments have been echoed by Oscar Wabwile Tela who is a brother to the deceased and who stated that the 2nd petitioner came along with her young three children when she married the deceased and that the deceased agreed to take them as his own and maintained them since he loved them. He also stated that in 2012 the deceased invited him for a ceremony wherein he introduced one of his sons sired out of wedlock namely Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa. It was his evidence that the 1st petitioner is ganging up with one John Kasembeli to disinherit the dependents of the deceased.  Geoffrey Musungu Walumbe a cousin to the deceased echoed the sentiments of Oscar Wabwile Tela that during the Bukusu ‘’Lufu’’ ceremony the clan members resolved that all the children of the 2nd petitioner who had been taken in by the deceased were deemed as the deceased’s children. He further stated that the deceased had taken parental responsibilities as he later circumcised the male childrenand lkater collected",court,53.02%,model
that the deceased had taken parental responsibilities as he later circumcised the male childrenand lkater collected dowry following the marriage of one of the female children who had came along with the 2nd petitioner.,court,52.81%,model
The 1st petitioner and his witnesses have strongly taken the view that the three children who came along with the 2nd petitioner during her marriage to the deceased are children of one Pinika Kitui Namachanja and that they have already been provided for in land parcel number East Bukusu/West Sangalo/487 and therefore should leave the 1st Petitioner and 3rd petitioner who are the biological children of the deceased to inherit land parcel East Bukusu/South Kanduyi/2612. The 1st petitioner has also maintained that Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa is a son to one Meshack Masinde Naracha and that he should pursue his interest there and should not claim from the deceased.,court,54.60%,model
"It transpired that the 2nd petitioner’s former husband Pinika Kitui Namachanja owned parcel number East Bukusu/West Sangalo/487 and that the 1st petitioner now insists that the three children that accompanied the 2nd petitioner during her marriage to the deceased should proceed to occupy the land and leave him alone with his sister (3rd petitioner). It also transpired there was a dispute about the identity of the biological father of one of the beneficiaries namely Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa. Whereas the  maintains that 2nd and 3rd Petitioners claimed that the father of the said beneficiary was the deceased herein, the 1st petitioner maintains that Meshack Masinde Naracha is the biological father of Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners have claimed that the deceased had introduced the said Patrick Wnyonyi Wekesa as his son in 2012 and organized a ceremony over the same. A perusal of the pleadings herein reveals that one Meshack Masinde Naracha filed an affidavit sworn on 24/11/2021 wherein he vehemently denied being the biological father and added that even though he had a relationship with Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa’s mother following the death of her husband, he did not sire him and that he later learnt from his mother that the person who sired him was indeed the deceased herein and he thus severed the relationship.  At the time of the hearing of this matter both the deceased herein was already dead as well as the mother of Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa and hence the only person who could shed more light regarding his paternity is Meshack Masinde Naracha but who has denied being his biological father. Matters have not been helped any better since none of the parties herein availed any DNA evidence linking the said Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa to the deceased as his biological father or even to Meshack Masinde Naracha who has distanced himself.",court,54.82%,model
"As the protestor has isolated the three children who acme alongside the 2nd petitioner during her marriage with the deceased, it was thus necessary for the said beneficiaries to prove the fact of dependency and show that the dceased had maintained them prior to his death. It is not in dispute that at the time of the marriage between the 2nd petitioner and the deceased, her three children sired by the late Pinika Kitui Namachanja were still minors and that thery grew up at the home of the deceased until the other children were (1st and 3rd petitioners) were born. If the said children remained with the deceased all that long, then it is obvious that the deceased had taken them in as his own children. The two clan elders, Oscar Wabwile Tela (PET. W6) and Geoffrey Musungu Walimbe (PET. W 8) confirmed that indeed the deceased had taken the three children born out of wedlock as his own and maintained them during his lifetime. They also stated that the said children were recognized as children of the deceased during the Bukusu ceremony (‘’lufu’’). Iam satisfied that the three beneficiaries namely Titus Nabukhamba Namachanja, Samuel Wanjala Wekesa and Violet Nanjala Wanyama have established on a balance of probabilities that they were mainatained by the deceased at the time of his death and are thus entitled to share in his estate. Even though the protestor and his witnesses have claimed that the said beneficiaries have already been provided for in the estate of Pinika Kitui Namachanja, I find such assertion does not prevent the said beneficiaries from having a shgare in the estyate of the deceased herein. The assets of the late Pinika Kitui Nmachanja are not part of the estate of the deceased herein and hence should not be used as a measure against what the beneficiaries are to get. The protestor’s grouse that his step- siblings are going to have more than him is thus not convincing since the two properties werer not wholly owned by the decased. The protestor therefore must be prepared to share the estate with his erstwhile step-siblings who apparently are children of two worlds so to speak. In any event, the issue of sharing need not necessarily be based on equality but equity.",court,54.29%,model
"As regards Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa, it is noted that he was not staying with the deceased all his youthful life until 2012 when the deceased is reported to have introduced him to the family and held a small ceremony for him where he announced that he was his son born out of wedlock. It is instructive that the said Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa left as soon as the ceremony was over and thus did not stay with the deceased. No evidence was shown the that the deceased maintained him prior to his death. In fact it transpired that the said beneficiary used to work and reside within the catholic church around Kanduyi. Consequently, I find that he has failed to prove dependency to the required standard and hence he will be excluded from the distribution. Towards this end therefore, the protestor’s claim only succeeds to the extent that Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa stands excluded from the estate while the other three beneficiaries Titus Nabukhamba Nmachanja, Samuel Wanjala Wekesa and Violet Nanjala Wanyama  as well as the 2nd and 3rd petitioners will be entitled to a share in the estate.
As regards the second issue, it is notted that the 2nd anD 3RD petitioners have come up with a reasonable mode of distribution of the estate which caters for the three children born out of wedlock as wellas the two biological children of the deceased including the 2nd petitioner. It is noted that during the hearing of the protest, it came out clearly that the protestor exhibited a lot of distain against the 2nd petitioner who is his own biological mother and the only surviving parent. This was quite astonishing. It also transpired that the protestor had teamed up with a few clan members to remove thos who were not biological children of the deceased and further extended the ban on his own mother. At the time of the hearing, his mother was reported to be staying with one of her sons who is not a biological child of the deceased as it was claimed that her homestead had been demolished. Even though the protestor claimed that the 2nd petitioner’s house had been damaged by flash floods, the same is not convincing as it is obvious that the 2nd petitioner had been evicted from her house as he was not wanted in the area. The proposed mode of distribution by the protestor is",court,54.82%,model
"not reasonable in the circumstances and is for rejection as there is element of discrimination. The proposed mode of distribution by the 2nd and 3rd petitioners appear to be reasonable save only that the share of Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa ought to be removed as he has not proved that he was a dependant of the deceased prior to his death. Hence, the share of that particular beneficiary will be distributed equally among the six beneficiaries.
In the result, the protestor’s protest partly succeeds to the extent that Patrick Wanyonyi Wekesa is not a beneficiary and that his share of 2 acres will be distributed among the six beneficiaries equally so that each beneficiary will get an extra 0.3 acres. Consequently, the grant issued on 29/9/2020 is hereby confirmed and that the estate will be distributed as follows:
1.Florence Namarome Wekesa(Widow)…………0.8 acres
2. Ann Kisaka Otieno(daughter)………………….1.3 acres
3. Samuel Wanjala (son)…………………………..0.8 acres
4. Violet Nanjala (daughter)…………………….0.55 acres
5. Titus Namukhamba (Son)……………………0.8 acres

(Before Hon. Justice Byram Ongaya on Friday 17th November, 2023)
RULING
The respondent has filed a notice of preliminary objection on a point of law application dated 24.03.2023 through Aduda & Company Advocates. The petitioner is in person.
The preliminary objection challenges the jurisdiction of the Honourable Court to hear and determine the matter, and was made upon the following grounds:
That the instant application has been filed in gross violation of the constitutional principle of avoidance.
That the instant petition does not raise any constitutional question(s) for the determination of this honourable court. 
That the instant petition is a gross abuse of due process as the exists sufficient statutory remedies to invoke 
That the instant petition is filed in gross abuse of due process as the same has purported to constutionalize an ordinary employer-employee dispute.  
That arising from above and as held by the supreme court of Kenya in the case of Communication Commission of Kenya & 5 others versus Royal Media Services Ltd Supreme Court of Kenya at Nairobi Petition no. 14 of 2014 this Honourable Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear and determine this petition and therefore the petition ought to be dismissed with costs. 
That arising from the above and as was held by the court of appeal in the case of Francis Gathugu Vs. Kenyatta University Civil Appeal no. 279 of 2013 any willy nilly attempt at constitutionalizing every common dispute must be discovered, named and rebuffed. 
That arising from the above and as was held in the case of the Owners of motor vessel ‘lilian S’ versus Caltex Oil (Kenya)(1989) [1KLR], a court without jurisdiction cannot proceed with the proceedings. 
Further to the above that jurisdiction is everything and without it a court cannot make one more step.",court,56.30%,model
"And finally, further to the above, a question as to the jurisdiction of the court must be heard and determined in priority to any other proceedings. 
The consequent upon the above, the respondent will at the hearing of this preliminary objection of law urge the honourable court to dismiss this petition with costs. 
The petitioner swore a replying affidavit on 28.04.2023 in response to the respondent’s notice of preliminary objection, and stated thus:
That the Honourable Court was moved through the notice of motion application dated 08.07.2021 (consolidated with the present petition) under all enabling provisions of the law including all the inherent powers of the Employment and Labour Relations Court under sections 1A,1B, 3A and 63(c) of the Civil Procedure Act, 2010, Order 51 rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010 as read together with the Employment & Labour Relations Court (Procedure) Rules, 2016. 
That the petition raises triable issues to the Honourable Court over the manner and style which the respondent repudiated or breached the petitioner’s contract of employment, a matter that falls within the purview of the provisions of section 12 (1)(a) of the employment & labour relations court act, laws of Kenya. 
That the petition is a formal application which falls within the purview of the provisions of section 12 (2) of the Employment & Labour Relations Court Act, as read together in the cited rules set out in rule 2 of the interpretation of legal notice no 146 of 2016 of the Employment & Labour Relations Court (Procedure) Rules 2016 where it is interpreted in the rules unless the context so requires. 
That the petitioner has moved the Honourable Court in the present application, claim or complaint in the form of a petition which is a formal application made to the Court in accordance with the provisions of section 12(2) of the Employment & Labour Relations Court Act laws of Kenya seeking jurisdictional action against the respondent action for breach of his employment contract.",court,56.97%,model
"That the decision in Communication Commission of Kenya & 5 others versus Royal Media Services Ltd Supreme Court of Kenya at Nairobi Petition no. 14 of 2014 together with the cited case of Francis Gathugu Vs. Kenyatta University Civil Appeal no. 279 of 2013 are all distinguishable from the present case in that the principle of avoidance was applicable in cited case laws. 
That the cited authorities are inapplicable in the instant case and the right case law applicable to this matter is United States International University Vs. Attorney General & 2 others (2012) eKLR equally Karisa Chengo & 2 others Vs. Republic Civil Appeal No. 44, 45 & 76 of 2014 (2015) eKLR and as held in the case of Owners of motor vessel ‘Lilian S’ v. Caltex Oil Kenya (1989) 1KLR1. 
That as a result of the authorities aforesaid, it is clear that the petition is sustainable against the respondent for breach of both the petitioner’s contractual and constitutional right to fair hearing and fair administrative action contemplated under Article 50(1) and (2). Article 47 of the constitution of Kenya as read together with the provisions of Rule 8(g), (h), (i) and (ii) of the respondent union constitution which raises triable issues that require the Court to probe and analyse facts of the case against each and every breach of right and fundamental freedom raised in the petition thereafter make a finding on the basis of its merit. 
That these are constitutional questions which the Court is seized with through the petition. The Court has jurisdictional authority to interpret and apply the constitutional issues raised in the present employment dispute and provide redress to violations of his constitutional rights in matters falling under its jurisdiction in line with the present case. 
That the preliminary objection filed is not on a point of law but raises a procedural technicality, an objection on the form used by the petitioner to approach the Court on a dispute of right to fair hearing, fair trial and right to due process of the law as opposed to the principle objective that established this court to effect substantive justice by facilitating the just, expeditious, efficient and proportionate resolution of disputes in line with section 3 of the Employment & Labour Relations Court Act.",court,56.73%,model
"That under Article 159 of the Constitution of Kenya the Court is bound by mandatory terms to exercise its judicial authority without undue regard to procedural technicality such as the one raised in the preliminary objection filed by the respondent. 
The preliminary objection does not meet the threshold of what a preliminary objection is as outlined in the case of Mukisa Biscuits Co. Ltd Vs. West- end distributors ltd (1966) EA 696 and also as set out in Avatar Sing Bhamra & Another V. Oriental Commercial Bank, Kisumu High Court Civil case No. 53 of 2004. 
The parties filed their respective submissions. The court has considered the parties’ respective positions and makes finding as follows.
The only issue is whether the petition is trapped by the principle of constitutional avoidance. The answer lies largely in the pleadings. The petitioner has alleged violation of his rights and fundamental freedoms including Articles 41, 50(1) and 47 (1) of the Constitution as set out in paragraphs 36 to 45 of the petition. The petitioner prays for a declaration that his rights and fundamental freedoms were violated. How then can the Court decide the issues without taking evidence on the express alleged constitutional violations? It appears that as urged for the petitioner, the preliminary objection will collapse as whether rights and fundamental freedoms were violated is in dispute and is a matter which must go to full hearing and determined after taking evidence. The preliminary objection fails to pass the threshold and will fail.
In conclusion the preliminary objection dated 24.03.2023 is hereby dismissed with costs in the cause and parties to fix the matter for further directions for expeditious determination of the petition.
Signed, dated and delivered by video-link and in court at Nairobi this Friday 17th November, 2023.

THAT the applicants be ordered to refund the total amount of money withdrawn from account number 0300181231321 at Equity bank belonging to Joseph Malakwen Samoei.
THAT costs of the application be in the cause.",court,55.59%,model
"THAT costs of the application be in the cause. 
The Application is premised on the grounds set out therein and the contents of the supporting affidavit sworn by the Applicant.
The Applicant contends that she is the legal wife to Joseph Malakwen Samoei and that her consent was not sought by the applicants while obtaining the court order issued on 16.02.2023. According to her, the applicants hid material facts from the court thus making the court to arrive at an unjust decision. 
The applicant averred that the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei has been working as an administrative officer until when he retired at the age of 60 years in the year 2020. 
The applicant further averred that throughout the years the 1st applicant has been trying to make withdrawals from the bank account number 01245029415900 at National Bank and the same has been stopped on numerous occasions but he would still access the same since he has taken hold of the original identity card of Joseph Malakwen Samoei. 
It was the applicant’s averment that as a result of the 1st applicant’s meddling with the estate of Joseph Malakwen Samoei to the detriment of his family members, some altercations have led to violence when the said 1st applicant assaulted the applicant. 
The 1st applicant upon realizing that he had been barred from accessing the known bank account for Joseph Malakwen Samoei at National Bank, he devised a method of opening another account at equity bank wherein the retirement benefits of Joseph Malakwen Samoei were deposited. Upon being granted the court orders to manage the assets of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei, the 1st applicant immediately withdrew a total of Kshs. 2,800,000/= to the detriment of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei, the applicant and their children.
The applicant averred that upon realizing that the retirement benefits of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei did not reflect in his National Bank Account but to an unknown bank account at Equity Bank, she then reported the matter at the DCI offices in Eldoret which investigations led to the freezing of the said bank account at Equity.",court,53.83%,model
"In response to the application, the 1st respondent averred that the court orders obtained by the applicant from this honourable court on 19.10.2023 were obtained through material non-disclosure and misrepresentation of several facts. It was his case that the orders issued on 21.7.2023 in Eldoret Misc. Application No. E353 of 2023 by Hon. D. Mikoyan (CM) were vacated by the said court on 4.10.2023 way before the application dated 19.10.2023 was filed contrary to crafty assertions made in paragraph 11 of her supporting affidavit dated 19.10.2023. 
The 1st respondent averred that the applicant approached the court with unclean hands by not disclosing that she had left one Joseph Malakwen Samoei and has been married to one Hillary Tuwei for the last twenty years since 2004 to date. Further that all children listed in a letter dated 111.10.2022 belong to one Hillary Tuwei and not Joseph Malakwen Samoei. 
The 1st respondent contended that he has been taking care of his brother since he became sick in the year 1999 and he stays with him at his place. That the applicant came into the picture when she got information that the retirement benefits of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei were released.  
The 1st respondent equally filed submissions in support of his response, in which he essentially submitted that pension monies are not matrimonial property and that if the applicant is appointed as he legal guardian of Joseph Malakwen, the court risks the property being misused by a party who has never cared to see the said Joseph Malakwen. 
Analysis & Determination
The court has carefully considered the application, response and submissions made by the respondent’s counsel. It is not in dispute that one Joseph Malakwen Samoei is suffering from a mental disorder. A letter dated 8th February, 2023 was adduced in evidence from Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital to confirm that fact. Section 2 of the Mental Health Act Cap 248 provides that:
“A person suffering from mental disorder” means a person who has been found to be suffering under this Act and includes a person diagnosed as a psychopathic person with mental illness and suffering from mental impairment due to alcohol or substance abuse.”",court,55.85%,model
"The court is empowered to grant orders sought by the application in relation to custody, management and guardianship under Section 26 of the Mental Health Act Cap 248 which provides:
“(1) The court may make orders:
a) For the management of the estate of any person suffering from mental disorder, and
b) For the guardianship of any person suffering from mental disorder by any near relative or by any other suitable person
c) Where there is no known relative or other suitable person, the court may order that the Public Trustee be appointed manager of the estate and guardian of any such person.
d) Where upon inquiries it is found that the person to whom the inquiry relates is suffering from mental disorder to such an extent as to be incapable of managing his affairs, but that he is capable of managing himself and is not dangerous to himself or to others or likely to act in a manner offensive to public decency, the court may make such orders as it may think just for the management of the estate of such person, including proper provision for his maintenance and for the maintenance of such members of his family as are dependent upon him for maintenance, but need not, in such case, make any order as to the custody of the person suffering from mental disorder.” 
Additionally, the authority to manage affairs of an estate of a patient is donated under Section 27 of the Mental Health Act whereas Section 28 of the same Act provides for management of the subject's estate.
In applying Section 26 and 27 of Cap 248, I am guided by the case of Re N M K (2017) eKLR where it was held as follows: -
“In considering an application brought under sections 26 and 27 of the Mental Health Act, the Court is guided by three main factors: 
There must be medical evidence warranting the determination by the Court that the Subject suffers from mental disorder;
The person to be appointed to be either a Guardian or Manager must be fit to be so appointed;
The Court must be satisfied that a proposed Manager will utilize her powers for the benefit and welfare of the Subject.”
The similar position was held in in re Estate VFM (Patient) [2020] eKLR, the court held that:
a) For the court to grant the application for appointment of a manager of the estate and guardian to the patient, the Petitioner/Applicant is duty bound to prove that:",court,56.37%,model
"b) There exists medical proof by show of evidence confirming that the subject suffers from mental disorder.
c) The petitioner/Applicant seeking to be appointed as manager or guardian must be legally fit to be so appointed.
d) That due to the subject’s mental disorder, he or she is incapable of managing his/her own affairs independently and responsibly.  
e) That the proposed manager/guardian will manage the subject’s property effectively and efficiently for the benefit of the estate and welfare of the subject.
The overall guiding principal in the application of all these factors is that it must be in the best interest of the subject. 
Based on the pleadings and the evidence presented, I a persuaded that the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei lacks the mental capacity which my view falls within the definition of Section 2 Cap 248. The same has affected his cognition and the ability to take care of his affairs or of himself. 
The issue having been settled; I shall then turn to determine whether the interested party should be appointed as guardian/ manager to the patient and the orders issued on 16.2.2023 appointing the respondents as the guardians be set aside. Section 26 of the Act as mentioned above, gives court the power to make an order regarding management of the estate of any person suffering from mental disorder to any relative or any person suitable but giving preference to a relative.
In the present case, the applicant averred that she is the legal wife of the said Joseph Malakwen Samoei having gotten married to him on 17.8.1991. I have however noted that the applicant has not indicated anywhere or proved cohabitation with the patient in the recent past and visited him where is ordinarily resides. The 1st respondent averred that the interested third party applicant left the patient and married one Hillary Tuwei, a fact that has not been disputed. The 1st respondent further averred that he has been taking care of his brother and that he has always accompanied him whenever he is going to collect his salary.
There is no indication from the applicant that he has ever been available for the patient to take good care of him. She has only relied on the fact that they were married years ago.",court,55.26%,model
"Having said so, it is clear that the Applicant has not received the full consent of the rest of the patient’s family. For the court to intervene in the management and control of the patient’s properties and estate the court has to put into consideration the provisions of Section 28 through to Section 39 of the Mental Health Act.   In particular, Section 33 requires a manager(s) so appointed by the court to furnish an inventory and annual accounts to the court and the Public Trustee. 
In the upshot, the court finds it proper to appoint the respondents to be the managers of the estate of the patient as the third party applicant becomes the patient’s guardian as enumerated hereunder: - 
i. That the third party/applicant is hereby appointed as the guardian of Joseph Malakwen Samoei, the patient herein suffering mental disorder in as far as the patient’s personal and medical care and maintenance is concerned.
ii. That respondents are jointly appointed managers of the estate of Joseph Malakwen Samoei and do furnish the court with an inventory of the estate of Joseph Malakwen Samoei of all his assets and liabilities within 30 days from today’s date for purposes of determination of the management of the patient’s estate.
It is so ordered.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 154 OF 2019
BETWEEN
KWACHA GROUP OF COMPANIES .…………..…..…………….……………... APPELLANT
AND
VENDING SERVICES …………………..…………..…………………..………….. RESPONDENT
 (Being an appeal from the Ruling and Order of Hon. E. K. Usui, SPM dated 25th February 2019 at the Magistrates Court at Nairobi, Milimani in Civil Case No. 6314 of 2018) 
JUDGMENT
This is an appeal from the ruling dated 25.02.2019 in which the trial magistrate allowed the Respondent’s application to strike out the defence under Order 2 Rule 15(1) (a) and (c) of the Civil Procedure Rules. The trial magistrate after setting out the principles for striking out in Tom Odhiambo Achilla t/a Achilla T.O. and Co. Advocates v Kenneth Wachira Akide t/a Akide and Co. Advocates and Others [2015]eKLR stated as follows:
I have read out the Plaint and the Defence filed in court.  I have also read the counter-claim between the parties prior to filing the suit. I am satisfied that the defendant’s defence is confused of mere denial circuses to triable issues. The application has merit. It is allowed as prayed.
The thrust of the Appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal dated 21.05.2019, is that the Ruling is devoid of substance, does not set the legal and factual basis and the analysis leading to the decision this resulting in a miscarriage of justice. The parties have filed written submissions in the matter which I have considered. 
It is not in dispute that power to strike out a claim is drastic and must be exercised with great circumspection. This is the Court of Appeal has stated many times. In D.T. Dobie & Company (Kenya) Ltd v Muchina [1982] KLR 1 it expressed the view that:",court,56.06%,model
"No suit ought to be summarily dismissed unless it appears so hopeless that it plainly and obviously discloses no reasonable cause of action and is so weak as to be beyond redemption and incurable by amendment. If a suit shows a mere semblance of a cause of action, provided it can be injected with real life by amendment, it ought to be allowed to go forward for a court of justice ought not to act in darkness without the full facts of a case before it.
In deciding whether to strike out the suit, the Court is required to examine the pleadings; the Plaint and Defence together with depositions in support of and in opposition to the application to strike out in order to determine whether there is a triable issue.
In this case, it is not apparent from the Ruling that the trial magistrate considered the Respondent’s claim and the Appellant’s statement of defence. A perusal of the plaint dated 02.07.2018 shows that the Respondent’s claim was for goods sold and delivered. The Respondent claimed Kshs. 520,026.00 with interest at commercial rates. In the defence dated 17.08.2018, the Appellant denied that it owed Kshs. 520,026.00. It averred that the services and goods were neither rendered nor delivered and that there was no factual basis for the claim.
The Respondent lodged the Notice of Motion dated 05.09.2018 seeking to strike out the defence. The application was supported by the affidavit of Neel Shah sworn on 02.07.2018 comprising statements of account, credit application form and emails. The Appellant filed grounds of opposition dated 08.01.2018 stating that the defence had triable issues. Unfortunately, the trial magistrate failed to engage with the pleadings and documents as it is difficult to know how the court came to the conclusion that those were not triable issues.",court,56.47%,model
"The fundamental rule governing decisions of any trial is that the ultimate decisions must set out reasons for the conclusion. The trial magistrate failed to explain why she came to the conclusion that the defence is comprised of mere denials and raises no triable issues. The duty to provide reasons is not only a function of due process but also abides by the rules of natural justice, particularly the right to a fair hearing which demands that parties know without any doubt why they won or lost, as without any reasons a losing party will not be able to know whether the court has misdirected itself and make a decision on whether they have a chance on appeal (see Flanner v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd (200) ALL ER 27, Mufrank Builders Limited v Kiriti Women Transport And Housing Co-Operative Society [2015] eKLR and Hellen Wangari Wangechi v Carumera Muthoni Gathua [2015] eKLR).
The duty to provide reasons is found in Order 21 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules which expressly provides that judgments “shall contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision.” This position was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Judicial Service Commission v Ndururi [2021] KECA 365 (KLR).
The Ruling appealed from was devoid of any reasons for the conclusion reached by the trial magistrate. In the circumstances, I allow the Appeal and order as follows:
The Ruling and Order dated 25.02.2019 is set aside and substituted with an order dismissing the Respondent’s application dated 05.09.2018.
The Respondent shall bear the costs of this Appeal assessed as Ksh. 20,000.00.
The suit, Milimani CMCC No. 6314 of 2018, be and is hereby transferred to the Milimani Small Claims Court for hearing and determination.

On cross examination, Dw. 3 confirmed that epilepsy can be managed by medical treatment and that epilepsy is a convulsion disorder.
On re-examination, Dw. 3 stated that epileptic patients at times turn out to be mental patients.
Mr. Nyadimo Learned Counsel representing the accused herein filed submissions in which he argued the defence of insanity.
He cited section 9 of the Penal Code CAP 63 Laws of Kenya which prescribes that a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his will, or for an event which occurs by accident.
The Learned Counsel relied on the following cases in support of the defence of insanity Leonard Mwangani Munyasia v Republic (2015) eKLR in which the court stated as follows; “It is a rule of universal application and of criminal responsibility that a man cannot be condemned if it is proved that at the time of the offence he was not a master of his mind.”",court,54.11%,model
"The Learned Counsel relied on the case of Richard Chemagong v Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 150 of 1983 where the Court of Appeal made reference to the McNaughten rules and sought to distinguish a malfunctioning of the mind from non-functioning of the mind due to epilepsy and held that there was ample evidence that the defendant therein was acting unconsciously and involuntarily when he inflicted the injury.
The Learned Counsel finally submitted that it was trite law that in order to establish a defence on the ground of insanity it must be proven that at the time of committing the act the accused was labouring under a defect of reason and cited section 166 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code CAP 75 Laws of Kenya to buttress his argument, the said provision states as follows; “Where an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence, and it is given in evidence on the trial of that person for that offence that he was insane so as not to be responsible for his acts or omissions at the time when the act was done or the omission made, then if it appears to the court before which the person is tried that he did the act or made the omission charged but was insane at the time he did or made it, the court shall make a special finding to the effect that the accused was guilty of the act or omission charged but was insane when he did the act or made the omission.”
The sole issue for consideration is whether the prosecution proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
The offence of murder is provided for in section 203 of the Penal Code that provides as follows; “Any person who of malice aforethought causes death of another person by an unlawful act or omission is guilty of murder.” In Republic v Andrew Omwenga [2009] eKLR the court held: “It is clear from this definition that for an accused person to be convicted of murder, it must be proved that he caused the death of the deceased with malice aforethought by an unlawful act or omission – there are therefore three ingredients of murder which the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt in order to secure a conviction. They are: (a) The death of the deceased and the cause of the death, (b) That the accused committed the unlawful act which caused the death of the deceased and (c) That the accused had the malice aforethought.”",court,57.76%,model
"The accused in this case was charged with the offence of murder contrary to section 203 of the penal code which defines murder as the unlawful killing of a person or persons with malice aforethought. 
(a) Death and Cause of Death
In this case the death of the deceased persons is not disputed, on the material night three lifeless bodies were found in the house of the accused person according to the eyewitness accounts of Pw. 1, Pw. 2, Pw. 3 and Pw. 4. 
On 9th July, 2018 Dr. Sammy Langat (Pw. 7) conducted post mortem examinations on the three deceased persons, his observations were that the deceased persons had sustained multiple cut wounds on the head and his findings were that the cause of death of all the three deceased persons was severe head injury and produced the post mortem reports as PExh. 2, 3 and 4.
Whether the accused committed the unlawful act which caused the death of the deceased
I am aware that there were no eyewitnesses to the assault of the deceased persons, as most of the prosecution witnesses testified that on the material night, they gathered outside the house of the accused after they heard commotion from the accused persons house, the house was locked and the crowd wanted to break in when the accused opened the door, came out of the house while swaying a panga and ran towards the river. When they entered the house, they stumbled upon the lifeless bodies of the deceased and it dawned on them that the accused had killed three people. I find that the accused persons' defence of insanity does not hold water in the circumstances of the offence and further that the fact that he suffers from epilepsy cannot explain the cold hearted murders and the callous and cavalier attitude after he committed the instant office. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused person who unlawfully caused the deceased's death.
Whether the Accused Person had Malice Aforethought.",court,54.82%,model
"Whether the Accused Person had Malice Aforethought.
 For the charge of murder to succeed, it must be proved that they acted with malice aforethought. Section 206 of the Penal Code provides circumstances from which malice aforethought may be inferred. They are: ""(a) An intention to cause death of or to do grievous harm to any person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not; (b)Knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of or grievous harm to some person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be cause;© An intention to commit a felony;(d)…"" In Republic v Tubere S/O Ochen [1945] 12 EACA 63 the court held that:- “an inference of malice aforethought can be established by considering the nature of the weapon used, the part of the body targeted, the manner in which the weapon was used and the conduct of the accused before, during and after the attack.” Having considered the brief facts of this case, I find that the accused person herein had malice aforethought, the accused used a jembe and a panga to assault the hapless victims in the wee hours of the night and whilst assaulting them targeted their heads and soon after he had inflicted fatal injuries, fled the scene of the crime, he was apprehended the following morning as he sought refuge at a nearby secondary school.
I do take cognizance of the fact that there are no eye witness accounts to the events leading to the demise of the deceased, however, I find that circumstantial evidence points to the culpability of the deceased. In Sawe v Rep [2003] KLR 364, the Court of Appeal expressed as follows: “In order to justify on circumstantial evidence, the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. There must be no other co-existing circumstances weakening the chain of circumstances relied upon. The burden of proving facts that justify the drawing of this inference from the facts to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis of innocence remains with the prosecution. It is a burden which never shifts to the party accused.”",court,55.29%,model
"Accordingly, I find that the defence put forward by the accused person namely:  Gideon Cheruiyot Langat does not displace the prosecution’s case. The prosecution has therefore proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and in the premises, I find the accused person guilty for the offence of Murder Contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. The accused person is hereby convicted.

 (Being an appeal from the Judgment and Decree of Hon. D.W. Mburu, SPM dated 29th January 2021 at the Magistrates Court at Nairobi, Milimani in Civil Case No. 1722 of 2019) 
JUDGMENT
This appeal is against the trial court’s judgment on quantum. The Respondent was injured in a road traffic accident that took place on 17.10.2017 while he was walking along the road when he was knocked down by the Appellant’s motor vehicle registration number KAW 701W. After hearing the case, the trial magistrate found the Appellant fully liable and awarded the Respondent Kshs. 850,000.00 and Kshs. 143,530.00 as general and special damages respectively. It is the award of general damages that has precipitated this appeal.",court,56.52%,model
"According to the Plaint dated 17.03.2018, the Respondent pleaded that he sustained a mid-shaft fracture of the left tibia and fibula and suffered a swollen tender and painful leg. In his testimony the Respondent confirmed these injuries. He produced a Discharge Summary from PCEA Kikuyu Hospital showing that he was admitted to the hospital on 19.12.2017 and discharged on 22.12.2017 for treatment of the left leg injury. The Respondent was also examined by Dr G. K. Mwaura on 04.01.2019 who prepared a report of even date. Dr Mwaura examined the P3 Medical Report, Discharge Summary, booking sheet and X-ray request form from Kiambu Level 4 Hospital. He confirmed that the Respondent suffered a fracture of the left tibia and fibula which was treated initially by application of plaster of paris and the tibia fracture fixed by a K-nail. When he was examined, the Respondent was heathy and normal. Dr Mwaura noted that the Respondent experiences pain on the left leg upon exertion and cannot walk or stand for a long time. He classified the injury as grievous harm and assessed permanent degree of incapacity at 10%.
In support of his plea to be awarded Kshs. 1,000,000.00, the Respondent cited several cases. In Hussein Abdi Hashi v Hassan Noor [2004] eKLR where the plaintiff sustained a fracture of the left malleoulus and metatarsal and laceration to the ankle, his incapacity was assessed at 20%. He was awarded Kshs. 800,000.00. In Abdi Salaan Nuron v Kenya Tea Development Authority  KRC HCCC No. 26 of 1999 (UR), the plaintiff was awarded Kshs. 800,000.00 after sustaining a fracture of the right tibia and fibula. He also cited Savco Stores Limited v David Mwangi Kimotho [2008] eKLR where the plaintiff suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula, fractured left elbow and deep cut on the forehead. He suffered permanent disability at 20% and was awarded Kshs. 800,000.00/",court,52.74%,model
"The Appellant urged the court to award Kshs. 300,000.00. It cited Civicon Limited v Richard Njomo Omwancha and 2 others [2019]eKLR. The court reduced an award of Kshs. 1,000,000.00 to Kshs. 450,000.00 for the 3rd plaintiff who suffered a fracture of the right tibia fibula, fracture of four upper teeth, cut wound on the upper and lower lip, swollen and tender upper lip, bruises on the chin, dislocation of the left shoulder and bruises on the right thigh. In Gladys Lyaka Mwombe v Francis Namatsi and 2 Others [2019]eKLR the plaintiff was awarded Kshs. 300,000.00 for sustaining a fracture of the lower tibia and fibula, a cut wound on the anterior part of the scalp, a head injury, spinal cord injury, neck injury and a cut wound on the face. 
In making the award, the trial magistrate found that the authorities cited by the Respondent were relevant and involved comparable injuries to those the plaintiff had sustained hence the award of Kshs. 850,000.00 would be appropriate for pain and suffering. 
The parties are agreed on the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the Respondent. The issue presented in this appeal as stated in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 24.11.2021 is whether the award was inordinately high and excessive in light of the injuries sustained by the Respondent. 
As this is an appeal on quantum of damages, the appellate court can only intervene if it is shown that the trial court, in awarding of the damages, took into consideration an irrelevant fact or the sum awarded is inordinately low or too high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage, or it should be established that a wrong principle of law was applied (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349).",court,55.56%,model
"This appeal concerns the award of general damages. General damages are damages at large and the court does the best it can in reaching an award that reflects the nature and gravity of the injuries. In assessing damages, the general method of approach should be that comparable injuries should as far as possible be compensated by comparable awards but it must be recalled that no two cases are exactly alike (see Stanley Maore v Geoffrey Mwenda NYR CA Civil Appeal No. 147 of 2002 [2004]eKLR). In addition, the current value of the shilling and the economy have to be taken into account and although astronomical awards must be avoided, the court must ensure that awards make sense and result in fair compensation (see Ugenya Bus Service v Gachoki NKU CA Civil Appeal No. 66 of 1981 [1982]eKLR and Jabane v Olenja [1986] KLR 661).
It is not in dispute that the Appellant sustained a fracture of the left tibia and fibula together with soft tissue injuries. The injuries have healed but have left him with difficulty in walking and permanent disability assessed at 10%. Looking at the cases cited by the Respondent before the trial court, I note that the victims therein suffered more serious and greater disability. Although the cases cited by the Respondent were decided in 2004 and 2008, those cited by the Appellant were more recent and reflective of the trend of damages awarded in cases of where the victims sustained similar injuries. 
Since the award of general damages was excessive, this court is entitled to intervene. I therefore set aside the award of Kshs. 1,000,000.00 and substitute with an award of Kshs. 600,000.00.
I allow the appeal to the extent that I set aside the award of general damages and substitute it with an award of Kshs. 600,000.00. The said sum shall accrue interest at court rates from the date of judgment in the subordinate court. 
The Appellant shall have costs of the appeal assessed at Kshs. 30,000.00.

INTER SECURITY SERVICES……………………………………….RESPONDENT
(Being an Appeal on the whole Judgment of Hon. F. N. Kyambia – CM at Mombasa delivered on 23rd July 2021 in CM ELRC 933 of 2019)
J U D G M E N T
The Appellant was the Claimant in Mombasa CM ELR Case No. 933 of 2019 whereby she had sued the Respondent herein vide a memorandum of claim dated 29/10/2019 and filed in Court on 30/10/2019.  The Appellant sought the following orders:-
a declaration that termination of the Appellant’s employment was unfair, unjust and wrongful.

costs of the suit and interest.
The Appellant had pleaded that she had been employed by the Respondent in 2007 and was earning ksh. 9000 per month at the time of termination on 30/8/2018.  That the termination was without justifiable cause, and was effected unfairly without following due process laid down in law, and without paying the Appellant’s dues.",court,53.36%,model
"Documents filed by the Appellant together with the memorandum of claim included the Appellant’s NSSF statement covering the period 2008 upto August 2018, employment identification card, a demand letter, response to the demand and the Appellant’s bank statements.
The Respondent defended the suit vide a memorandum of response dated 30/1/2020 and filed in Court on 3/2/2020.  The Respondent denied the Appellant’s claim and pleaded that the Appellant had been employed by the Respondent as a day security guard and was deployed at  various duty stations, the last one having been National Museums of Kenya Mombasa, whose contract with the Respondent expired on 31/7/2018.  That the Respondent issued the Claimant with a termination notice on 29/6/2018.
The Respondent further pleaded that it separated with the Appellant lawfully and paid her dues; including her salary for July 2018.  The Respondent further pleaded that the Appellant’s salary included an element for accommodation, that the Appellant was paid in lieu of leave and public holidays.
The Respondent further pleaded that it separated with the Appellant on 31/7/2018, and she instituted suit in the trial Court on 30/10/2019; and that accordingly; the Appellant’s claim for continuing injury (namely underpayment, house allowance, unpaid leave days, unpaid holidays and payments of deductions) are statutorily time barred.
Documents filed by the Respondent together with the Memorandum of Response included a notice of termination dated 29/6/2018, termination letter dated 29/6/2018 and response letter dated 26/8/2018.",court,53.61%,model
"At the trial, the Appellant testified that she worked for the Respondent for 10 years, working from 6.00am to 6.00pm, working on holidays, without leave and without overtime payment.  That after work on 31/8/2018, she received a call from her boss who told her not to go to work.  That she nevertheless went to work on 1/9/2018 and found another person.  That she was not given either a termination notice or letter and that she has not received the letters shown to be dated 29/6/2018.  The Appellant adopted her filed witness statement as her testimony.
Cross-examined, the Appellant testified that she was not given a contract during the 10 years she worked, that she had not seen the letters dated 29/6/2018 and 26/8/2018 respectively; and that she was not privy to any contract between the Respondent and National Museums of Kenya.
The Respondent on the other hand called one witness (RW-1) who adopted his filed witness statement as his testimony and produced in evidence documents filed by the Respondents.  RW-1 further testified that the Appellant worked with the Respondent as a day security guard from 2008 to 2018, was issued with a termination notice, and that her salary, which she had agreed to, included house allowance.  The Respondent denied the Appellant’s assertion that she never took leave and testified that the Appellant was duly compensated for holidays worked, and that NSSF and NHIF dues were duly submitted.  That the Appellant was fairly terminated.
Cross-examined, the Respodnent (RW-1) admitted that the Respondent had not produced in Court the Appellant’s contract, and had also not produced any leave application forms and had not produced payslips to show that the Appellant had been paid for holidays worked.  RW-1 further admitted that the letters produced by the Respondent in evidence had nothing to show that they had been received by the Appellant.",court,51.99%,model
"The trial Court delivered its judgment on 23/7/2021 and returned a finding that the Appellant had been fairly terminated upon being given a termination notice and notice of impending termination following the expiry of a contract between the Respondent and National Museums of Kenya.  The trial Court further made a finding that the Appellant had failed to prove her claim against the Respondent, and dismissed the same in its entirety with costs to the Respondent.
Aggrieved by the said judgment, the Appellant preferred the present appeal and set forth the following grounds of appeal:-
the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in dismissing the Appellant’s appeal.
the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering the oral evidence by the Appellant and the Respondent adduced in Court regarding the claim in question.
the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider evidence and submissions presented by the Appellant in considering the claim in question.
the Learned Magistrate’s judgment was against the weight of the need to dispense justice with fairness, and thus bad in law.
The Appellant is seeking the following reliefs:-
that the appeal be allowed with costs.
that the trial Court’s judgment in CM ELR Cause no. 933 of 2019 delivered on 23/7/2021 by Hon. F.N. Kyambia (MR) Chief Magistrate be set aside.
that an award be entered in favour  of the Appellant.
that costs of the appeal be awarded to the Appellant.
This is a first appeal.  The entire case as presented before the trial Court is open to fresh consideration.  A first Appellate Court is empowered to subject the whole of the evidence adduced in the trial Court to fresh and exhaustive scrutiny and to make conclusions about it; bearing in mind that it did not have the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses first hand.  This duty was stated in SELLE & ANTOEHR -VS- ASSOCIATED MOTOR BOAT CO. LTD & OTHERS [1968] EA 123.
Upon considering the pleadings filed and evidence presented  in the trial Court, issues that present for determination, in my view, are:-
whether termination of the Appellant’s employment was unfair.
whether the Appellant is entitled to the reliefs sought in the trial Court.",court,56.70%,model
"whether the Appellant is entitled to the reliefs sought in the trial Court.
On the first issue, it was a common ground that the Appellant was employed by the Respondent as a day security guard in 2008, and worked for ten years (until 2018) and that she was earning ksh. 9,000 per month at the time of termination of her employment.  The Appellant testified that she was not given a contract, that she worked until 31/8/2018 and that while at home, she was called by her boss and told not to go to work.  That she nevertheless went to work on 1/9/2018 but found another person.  That she was not served with a termination notice or a termination letter; and had not been notified of any impending termination.  That she had not seen the letters dated 29/6/2018 and 26/8/2018 which the Respondent produced in Court.
The Respondent, on the other part, admitted that there was nothing on record to show that the letters (notices) dated 29/6/2018 on termination of the Appellant’s employment and termination of the Respondent’s contract with National Museums of Kenya had been served on the Appellant.  The Respondent did not, therefore, rebut the Appellant’s evidence that she was not informed of any impending termination of employment, and was not issued with a termination notice.
Failure by an employer to issue a termination notice under Section 35(1) (c) of the Employment Act renders termination of an employee’s employment unlawful, and therefore unfair.  On this account, I find and hold that termination of the Appellant’s employment was unfair, and I so declare.
The trial Court fell into error by holding that the Appellant had been given a termination notice when the alleged termination notice was not shown to have been received by and/or served on the Appellant, and when even the Respondent’s witness admitted in evidence that the Respodnent had nothing to show that the alleged notice had been received by the Appellant.",court,53.81%,model
"On the second issue, and having made a finding that termination of the Appellant’s employment was unfair, and taking into consideration the circumstances in which the Appellant’s employment was terminated, I award the Appellant the equivalent of ten months’ salary in compensation for unfair termination of employment; that is ksh. 9000x10 = ksh. 90,000.
The claim for one month salary in lieu of notice is allowed at ksh. 9,000 as the Appellant never demonstrated that she was entitled to salary at a higher rate.  She never pleaded with particulars the relevant minimum wage guidelines for any particular periods of time during the employment period.  the Court cannot act on general allegations.  Further, no evidence was adduced by the Appellant to demonstrate entitlement to a higher rate of salary.
Further, and as correctly pleaded by the Respondent, the claims for salary underpayment, unpaid house allowance, unpaid leave and  unpaid holidays are in the nature of continuing injury as contemplated in Section 90 of the Employment Act.  Action on such claims should be brought within twelve months upon ceasation thereof.  In the present case, the ceasation date was the date of termination of the Appellant’s employment, which was 31/8/2018 according to the Appellant’s pleadings and evidence.
The Appellant’s suit in the trial Court was filed on 30/10/2019, over twelve months from the date of ceassation/termination.  Whether proved at trial or not, such claims were/are statute bared, and cannot be considered by this Court.  I uphold the trial Court’s dismissal of the same, though for different reasons.
The claim for severance pay cannot be allowed as termination of the Appellant’s employment did not result from redundancy.",court,54.21%,model
"The claim for unremitted deductions was not proved, and cannot be granted.  I have severally stated, and I repeat it here, that once statutory deductions are made from an employee’s salary by an employer, such deductions cease to be the property of the employee.  The deductions become the property and right of the statutory bodies on whose account the deductions are made.  Such statutory bodies i.e NSSF and NHIF, have statutory mechanisms on how to pursue employers for remittance of any withheld deductions.  An employee cannot lawfully seek to be refunded such deductions, unless it is demonstrated that the employer was not authorized in law to make such deductions.
The appeal herein partly succeeds.  The trial Court’s judgment delivered on 23/7/2021 is hereby set aside, and is substituted with a judgment for the Appellant against the Respondent as follows:-
Compensation for unfair termination 
of employment……………………………………………….ksh. 90,000
One month salary in lieu of notice …………………....ksh. 9,000
Total           ksh. 99,000
The Appellant is awarded costs of the appeal and costs of the proceedings in the Court below. Costs of the appeal shall be assessed on the lower scale.
The Appellant is also awarded interest at Court rates, to be calculated from the date of this judgment.

"PLAINTIFF’S CASE
 PW1 adopted his Witness Statement  dated 30th April 2018 and produced the documents in the list of documents as Pex No 1 to 18 save for the valuation report.
 PW1 stated that he was at all material times the registered lessee of all that piece of land Portion No. 5546 delineated on Survey Plan No. 158373, C.R. No. 23699 situate in Malindi Township within Kilifi County.  He further stated that he purchased the suit land from the 1st Defendant  on 20th December 1993, paid a consideration of  Kshs. 145,000/- and a transfer in his favour duly registered on 31st December 1993. 
PW1 testified that subsequently, and upon the requisite building approvals from the then Municipal Council, he  constructed a double storey building which he managed to rent out to five tenants earning  a total of Kshs. 28,675/- monthly rental income in   January 2018. 
 It was PW1’s evidence that he enjoyed quiet possession until the morning of 12th February 2018 when the 1st Defendant without notice wrongfully entered the suit property, evacuated the tenants and demolished the building. As a result of what he referred to as wrongful demolition, the Plaintiff alleged that the building has since become inhabitable causing him substantial loss and anguish. 
 The Plaintiff withdrew the suit against the 2nd Defendant vide a Notice to Withdraw dated 4th July 2019.
On cross-examination by Mr. Awino, PW1 testified that he developed the suit land between 2002 and 2003 and spent about Kshs.  12-13million but he did not have the receipts to show in court. He stated that half of the building was demolished and was not agreeable to the 1st Defendant rebuilding the half unless they put up a fresh one. 
 PW2 Edwin Otieno Oduor, a professional Valuer conducted a valuation on the suit land and prepared and produced the valuation report dated 5th April 2018. On cross-examination by Mr. Baraza, counsel for the 1st Defendant, PW2 told the court that the demolition affected the foundation of the building and the walls.
      DEFENDANT’S CASE",court,52.45%,model
"DEFENDANT’S CASE
 DW1 Joshua Odege Sanduk a licenced Surveyor adopted his Witness Statement dated 1st July 2019 and stated that he had been an employee of the 1st Defendant for 13 years. He testified that the damage on the building occurred as collateral damage during execution of a court order and  indicated that the 1st Defendant was willing to restore the building to its original state and that they be allowed to do so.
 DW1 confirmed on cross-examination by Mr. Binyenya, that the suit land belonged to the Plaintiff and that the 1st Defendant made a mistake demolishing the building. 
       PLAINTIFF’S SUBMISSION
Mr. Binyenya counsel for the Plaintiff filed submissions and largely reiterated the facts established in the parties’ pleadings and evidence adduced in court. He submitted that the Plaintiff was entitled to damages for loss and injury suffered. 
It was  counsel’s submissions that  the general rule regarding the measure of damages was that the injured party ought to be awarded a sum so as to put him in a position similar or nearly close to the position he would have been had he not sustained the loss. 
Counsel relied on the cases of   Total Kenya Limited formerly Caltex Oil Kenya Limited v Janevams Limited [2015] eKLR; and Peter M. Kariuki v Attorney General [2014] eKLR.
     ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION
It was undisputed that the Plaintiff was the rightful owner of the suit land and building thereon. The 1st Defendant admitted that they indeed wrongfully demolished the Plaintiff’s building. It follows therefore that the sole issue for determination in this case is whether the Plaintiff is entitled to damages and costs of this suit as prayed.
Under Section 13(7) of the Environment and Land Court Act No.19 of 2011, the Court has jurisdiction as follows:-
In exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act, the Court shall have power to make any order or grant, any relief as the Court deems fit and just including:-
a) Interim or permanent preservation orders including injunction.
b) Prerogative orders
c) Award of damages
d) Compensation
e) Specific performance
f) Restitution
g) Declarations or
h) Costs.",court,54.24%,model
"e) Specific performance
f) Restitution
g) Declarations or
h) Costs.
The Plaintiff sought special damages in the sum of Kshs. 12,000,000/- indicating that being the sum expended in constructing the building back in the year 2002. Special damages must be specifically pleaded and   proved.
  In the case of  Swalleh C. Kariuki & another v Viloet Owiso Okuyu [2021] eKLR   the court held that :
“Special Damages must be both pleaded and proved, before they can be awarded by the Court. Suffice it to quote from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Hahn V. Singh, Civil Appeal No. 42 Of 1983 [1985] KLR 716, at P. 717, and 721 where the Learned Judges of Appeal - Kneller, Nyarangi JJA, and Chesoni Ag. J.A. - held:
“Special damages must not only be specifically claimed (pleaded) but also strictly proved…. for they are not the direct natural or probable consequence of the act complained of and may not be inferred from the act. The degree of certainty and particularity of proof required depends on the circumstances and nature of the acts themselves.”
 The Plaintiff’s documentary evidence in support of the special damages is a bill of quantities for a proposed residential house on Plot No. 5546. On perusal of that document, it shows that the document was prepared in February 2018 yet the construction was done back in 2002. Again, the total estimation was calculated at Kshs. 12,884,745/-. It is not explained why the Plaintiff would then claim only a sum of Kshs. 12,000,000/- out of that amount. 
The Plaintiff conceded in his testimony that he did not have any receipts in support of the construction expenses. I thus find that the prayer for special damages in the sum of Kshs. 12,000,000/- has not been proved.",court,54.52%,model
"The Plaintiff also prayed for loss of future earnings in the form of rental income at the rate of Kshs. 31,000/-. In the case of Douglas Kalafa Ombeva v David Ngama [2013] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held that loss of earnings is a special damage claim, and as already established, it is paramount that special damages are pleaded and proved. The Plaintiff pleaded that the rental statement for January 2018 from his five tenants amounted to Kshs. 31,000/-. The Plaintiff explained that his estate agents Malindi Real Agency Limited would deduct 8 percent from the rent collected.
 The Plaintiff exhibited a copy of an account statement dated 10th February 2018 from the said Agents establishes that the Plaintiff’s rental income for the month of January 2018 was indeed Kshs. 31,000/-. In the circumstances, I find that the Plaintiff is entitled to prayer to the rental income as prayed.
In the alternative, the Plaintiff sought compensatory damages based on full repayment value of the building prior to the demolition together with unencumbered open market value of the suit land in the sum of Kshs. 30 million. The expert evidence produced by the Plaintiff was not controverted by the 1st Defendant. I will therefore rely on the valuation report exhibited by PW2. 
PW2 observed that the building was situated in a fast developing neighborhood identified as Ngala Phase 4 within Malindi Town. He also established that the part demolition affected the building’s foundation and therefore was not habitable. That the building could not be renovated due to the major damage caused. He estimated the market value of the building at Kshs. 30,000,000/-. 
The evidence on record established that the demolition did not affect the suit land. In the absence of any other valuation report to rebut the one on record, I am inclined to award compensatory damages as pleaded. In any event, the 1st Defendant conceded to their willingness to compensate the Plaintiff for the loss caused.
I therefore find that the Plaintiff has partially  proved his case and make the following specific orders;
A declaration that the Plaintiff is the genuine and rightful owner of portion No. 5546 Malindi.",court,53.22%,model
"Loss of future earnings in the form of rental income from the suit land as the same rate of Kshs. 31,000.00 a month from the 1st day of March, 2018 until the date of the judgment herein.
An order is hereby issued for  compensatory damages as full payment of the value of the suit property as per the Valuation report  in the sum of  Kshs 30,000,000/

JUDGMENT
Through   a certificate of urgency filed   on 22th April 2022 the petitioner   filed a Notice of Motion   together    with the petition   on the basis   that his rights     under Articles, 23, 24 & 25, read together   with Article   50(2)   have been violated - that Section 3 and 4 (2)   of the Probation of Offenders Act   are applicable   to him and that Section 333 of the Criminal Procedure Code should    be applied   to him.  
I have perused   the petition, the    affidavit    in support, the record in HCCRA 2/2019.
The petitioner was charged   with three   counts of   Sexual   Assault   Contrary to Section 5(1) (a) (1) (2) of the Sexual Offences Act.",court,54.84%,model
"He was convicted   and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment    on each count to run concurrently on 17th December 2018 in Kilungu MC SOA 18/18.
He then filed an appeal - HCCRA 2/19.
On 11th October 2019 the High Court   dismissed his appeal against the   conviction and sentence - and directed that the sentence to run from the date of his arrest.  
In support of his petition   the petitioner filed submissions on 6th October 2022.  He submitted   that he was an old man “to   waste all those years in custody” and was seeking a non-custodial   sentence.  
He urged the court to set him free. 
On its   part the state objected to the petition -  that the petitioner   had filed   an appeal which   had been determined by court of   equal jurisdiction and was seeking   this court to sit on appeal of another Judge’s judgment.
That the period spent in custody pending the hearing and determination of his case in the subordinate court was considered   during the appeal.  That the petition had no merit. 
The issue for determination is whether the petition/application for revision has any merit. 
It is true that the petitioner did file an appeal no. 2/2019 which was heard and determined by the Hon. Justice C. Kariuki.  
 That    the court dismissed   his appeal, sustained the conviction   and the sentence and directed that the sentence to start from the date the appellant was arrested. In the circumstances - Section 333 of the Criminal Procedure Code is   not applicable to the petitioner.  
With respect to alleged   violation of   his rights -  there is no evidence    that the applicant   has given   to this court to demonstrate that any   of the rights he alleges to have been violated were violated. 
 As to whether the applicant should   serve a non-custodial    sentence the petitioner gives the reason/ground - that he is too old to waste all that time in prison – really? The petitioner is not seeing the value of his imprisonment as a consequence of a legitimate sentence - if he considers it a waste of time - then perhaps he has not appreciated the fact that he was found guilty of a sexual offence.  
 In addition, his appeal against the conviction and sentence   was dismissed, the conviction and sentence upheld by this court.",court,56.24%,model
"It is my view that the orders sought by the petitioner   are actually a further appeal disguised as a petition/ criminal revision. They can only come from the superior court.  
In the circumstances the petitioner/revision is   without merit, the same is dismissed accordingly.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. E762 OF 2021
MANA PAHRMACY LTD……................................. APPELLANT
-VERSUS-
SAI PHARMACEUTICALS LTD……………..........RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the ruling of Hon. D. W. Mburu (SPM) in Milimani CMCC No. E8520 OF 2021 delivered on 12/11/2021
JUDGMENT
This appeal arose out of a ruling delivered on 12/11/2021 in a notice of preliminary objection filed by the appellant on the basis that CMCC no. E8520 of 2020 was sub judice since it was a duplicity of another suit namely BUNGOMA CMCC No. 25 of 2020.
Further, that the trial court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter since the contractual place where both the appellant and respondent reside and carry on business was outside the jurisdiction of the trial court.
The trial court dismissed the notice of preliminary objection on the basis that no pleading in respect of BUNGOMA CMCC E025 of 2020 were tabled before the trial court to enable it make a determination.
The appellant has appealed to this court on the following grounds.
THAT the learned magistrate erred in law and misdirected himself when he failed to consider the applicants’ submissions on points of law and facts on jurisdiction.
THAT the learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to analyse or to give consideration to the evidence adduced by the appellant and thereby arriving at a decision which was erroneous in the circumstance.
THAT the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to find that the issues of appellant’s place of business, place of carrying on business, arose to affirm that the honourable court lacked jurisdiction and they were already admitted and not contested by the respondent in their submissions.
THAT the learned magistrate erred in fact in finding that the appellant had failed to attach pleadings from Bungoma CC No. E025 of 2020 when in fact they had attached the same to their submissions.",court,57.37%,model
"The parties filed submissions as follows: the appellant submitted that the learned magistrate erred in law and misdirected himself in paragraph 9 of the ruling by noting that the appellant had failed to provide the court with a copy of the said pleadings which was not the case. The copy of the plaint was part of the bundle of documents attached to the appellant’s duly filed submissions.
The appellant further submitted that the appellant is a non-resident defendant within the description of Section 15 of the Civil Procedure Act Cap 21 which provides
“Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction—  
 the defendant or each of the defendants (where there are more than one) at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or
any of the defendants (where there are more than one) at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided either the leave of the court is given, or the defendants who do not reside or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid acquiesce in such institution; or  
the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises”
There was no express contract between the plaintiff and defendant companies. The place where the contract was to be performed or performance thereof completed was the place of delivery of the goods which was the defendant’s principal and only place of business in Bungoma. The place where the money was expressly or impliedly payable was also the defendant’s place of business in Bungoma County. The appellant in support cited Mombasa HC CA 178 of 2016; County Government of Kakamega v Ufanisi Freighters (K) Limited Trawlers Limited [2018] eKLR allowed an appeal and agreed that the lower court had no jurisdiction in a case filed for the recovery of money for work procured on the basis that the defendant (appellant) offices were located and contract to be performed in Kakamega while the case was filed in Mombasa.  
The appellant further submitted that this suit is a mere replica and /or duplicity of Bungoma CC E025/2020 where the parties herein are directly involved and the matters herein raised are substantially in issue.",court,55.79%,model
"The respondent submitted that the learned magistrate analysed the law and considered the appellant’s counsel’s submission on point of territorial jurisdiction and doctrine of duplicity. The Magistrate observed that matters as to where cause of action arose, place where contract was made and place where parties ordinarily carry on business are matters of fact which are contestable and since they require evidence cannot conclusively determine the suit as is expected of a Preliminary Objection.
On the issue as to whether the suit is sub judice the appellant had not placed before the court any material to enable the court to make a determination as to whether the parties in Nairobi MCCC E8520 of 2021 were related to the parties, issues and subject of Bungoma CMCC E025 of 2020. The respondent submitted that sub judice rule would not apply as there is no identity of the matter in issue in both suits. 
Further that the preliminary objection fails the test for applicability of the subjudice rule because if a final decision is to be reached on Bungoma MCC E025 of 2020 such decision would not operate as res judicata in Nairobi MCCC E8520 of 2021.
The respondent argued that the Notice of Preliminary Objection is not argued on the assumption that all facts pleaded by the Plaintiff are correct. Therefore, the facts have to be ascertained and the issues cannot be conclusively be determined at a preliminary stage. That the appeal herein therefore lacks merit as the trial magistrate was correct in his finding.
The duty of the first appellate court is re-evalaute the evidence before the trial court and to arrive at its own conclusion whether to support the findings of the Trial court.
The issues for determination in this appeal are as follows;
Whether the trial court was right in dismissing the notice of preliminary objection.
Whether the appeal should be allowed.
Who pays the costs of this appeal?
On the issue as to whether the trial court was right in dismissing the notice of preliminary objection, the issues  raised in the  preliminary objection could not be conclusively be determined since no materials were placed before the court to show that the parties in Nairobi MCCC E8520 of 2021 and BUNGOMA CMCC No. 25 of 2020 were the same .
 I find that details of BUNGOMA CMCC No. 25 of 2020 have not been availed.",court,57.71%,model
"The plaint describes the physical office of the defendant as based in Nairobi.  A suit can be filed where the defendant resides or where the cause of action arose.
 The Court of Appeal in Christopher Orina Kenyariri t/a Kenyariri & Associates Advocates v Salama Beach Hotel Limited & 3 others [2017] eKLR stated as follows:-
“…….section 15 of the Civil Procedure Act makes provision on where suits should be filed and requires that suits should be filed where the defendant lives or where the cause of action arises.”

CIVIL CASE NO. 373 OF 2010
HEZEKIAH OIRA.................................................. PLAINTIFF
VERSUS
PATRICK QUARCOO………................................DEFENDANT
RULING
The application coming for consideration is the one dated 6/3/2023 brought under Section 1A, 1b and 3a OF THE Civil Procedure Act, Under Order 22 rule 22, Order 40, Rules 1, and 4, Order 42, Rule 6, Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, Cap 21 Laws of Kenya and all other enabling provisions of law seeking the following orders;
This application be certified urgent and service thereof be dispensed with and the same be herd ex-parte in the first instance.
Pending the hearing and determination of this application, this honourable court be pleased to grant a stay of execution of the judgment delivered by Hon. Justice Sergon on 24th February 2023 in HCCC NO. 373 of 2010 – Nairobi and any other decree that ensue therefrom.
The costs of this application be provided for.
Any other orders that the honourable court may deem fit to grant.
The application is based on the following grounds;
On 24th February 2023, the honourable court delivered judgment in favour of the plaintiff and awarded him kshs.3,300,000 in damages.
The defendant is dissatisfied with the decision and intends to appeal against it.  The defendant has filed a notice of appeal and requested for typed proceedings and a certified copy of the judgment.
The defendant has an arguable appeal which will be rendered nugatory in the event a stay of execution for the following reasons, among others:
The impugned letter of 8th June 2010 was written by the defendant in his capacity as the Chief Executive Officer of Radio Africa Limited and addressed to the plaintiff as the Corporation Secretary of Kenya Broadcasting Corporation and discussed actions taken by Kenya Broadcasting Corporation.  Companies operate through their officials and it is arguable that any defamation suit should have instead been instituted by Kenya Broadcasting Corporation against Radio Africa Limited.",court,55.87%,model
"The letter of 8th June 2020 was covered by qualified privileges as it aimed to discharge a private duty, the defendant as the Chief Executive Officer of Radio Africa Limited had a legitimate interest in the subject matter of the letter and the letter raised a complaint about a statutory body which has a public authority or responsibility.
The contents of the letter of 8th June 2020 were substantially true.
The letter of 8th June 2020 as a demand letter and there was no malice on the part of the defendant, as the Chief Executive Officer of Radio Africa Limited, in communicating their dissatisfaction with Kenya Broadcasting Corporation on how the latter had handled Memorandum of Understanding the parties had made.
When delivering the judgment, the Honourable Court granted the defendant a 30 day stay of execution pending the filing of a formal stay application.  The stay is scheduled to lapse on 26th March 2023.
The defendant stands to suffer substantial loss in the event the judgment of 24th February 2023 is not stayed, and the plaintiff is allowed to commence the execution process for kshs.3,300,000 he was awarded as damages.  The defendant is apprehensive that in the event the appeal is successful, he will be unable to recover the sums and/or will be subjected to lengthy litigious process for the recovery of the sums which will expose the defendant to further expenses.
The defendant is willing to deposit the decretal sum as security in a joint interest earning account in the names of the advocates representing the parties.
This application has been brought timeously and without unreasonable delay and it is in the interest of fairness and justice that this application is heard urgently at the court’s earliest convenience.
The plaintiff will not be prejudiced if the orders sought herein are granted.
It is in the interest of justice that this application is allowed.
The application is supported by the affidavit of the applicant PATRICK QUARCOO sworn on 6/3/2023 which reiterates the grounds on which this application is premised.",court,54.96%,model
"The respondent Hezekia Oira filed a replying affidavit sworn on 25/4/2023 opposing the application dated 6/3/2023 in which he deponed that the judgment in HCCC No. 373 of 2010 was delivered on 24/2/2023. The court found as a fact the letter written by the applicant on 8/6/2010 that disparaged the respondent was false and that the applicant was actuated by malice and because the respondent’s employer KBC dismissed and got the respondent prosecuted never mind that he was acquitted had achieved his malicious intentions
The judgement that was delivered awarded the respondent a sum of Kshs 3,000,000 general damages for defamation and Kshs 300,000 for aggravated damages making a total of total of Kshs. 3,300,000. The applicant was granted a temporary stay of execution for 30 days to pay but to date he has not done the same and has instead brought this present application seeking for stay pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal.
Apart from the speculative allegations the applicant has not given any evidence of substantial loss or any reason why he thinks that he will be unable to recover the said sum. He indicated that as an advocate of the high court he will be able to refund the decretal sum to the applicant in the event he succeeds in the appeal.
The applicant filed a supplementary affidavit sworn on 28/4/2023 in response to the replying affidavit.
The parties filed written submissions as follows; the applicant in his submission indicated that he would suffer substantial loss  and his appeal will be rendered nugatory unless the orders sought herein are granted. He contended that he has an arguable appeal that ought to be considered on its merits by the court of appeal.
The applicant further submitted that the respondent bears the burden of proving his ability to repay the decretal sum once the applicant has raised his reasonable apprehensions to the court and in support cited the case of National Industrial Credit Bank Ltd v Aquinas Francis Wasike & another [2006] eKLR the Court of Appeal considered this burden as follows:",court,55.55%,model
"“This Court has said before and it would bear repeating that while the legal duty is on an applicant to prove the allegation that an appeal would be rendered nugatory because a respondent would be unable to pay back the decretal sum, it is unreasonable to expect such an applicant to know in detail the resources owned by the respondent or lack of them. Once an applicant expresses that a respondent would be unable to pay back the decretal sum, the evidential burden must then shift to the respondent to show what resources he has since that is a matter which is peculiarly within his knowledge.”
The applicant contended further that he has complied with the courts directions on security and urged this court to consider the holding in Focin Motorcycle Co. Limited vs. Ann Wambui Wangui & Another [2018] eKLR where it was held that
“…Where the applicant proposes to provide security as the Applicant has done, it is a mark of good faith that the application for stay is not just meant to deny the respondent the fruits of judgment.  My view is that it is sufficient for the applicant to state that he is ready to provide security or to propose the kind of security but it is the discretion of the Court to determine the security.  The Applicant has offered to provide security and has therefore satisfied this ground for stay…”
The respondent submitted that the applicant alleges that he has an arguable appeal however no memorandum of appeal was attached to the application to ascertain whether the applicant has a good appeal with a chance of success. The applicant has also not assigned any error in the learned judge’s finding or any evidence to justify his perception. 
The respondent argued that the applicant’s apprehension that he would be unable to refund the decretal sum cannot be a ground of granting of stay of execution. Moreover, this court and the court of appeal has held severally that in a money judgement the applicant must demonstrate with evidence that the respondent will not be able to refund the money and also by evidence the damages he will suffer unless the order is granted.
The issues for determination in this application are as follows;
Whether the application was filed without undue delay.
Whether the applicant is entitled to stay pending appeal.
I find that the application was filed on 6/3/2023 one month after the judgment was delivered on 24/2/2023.
I also find that the applicant has deposited security for the due performance of the decree.",court,56.34%,model
"I also find that the applicant has deposited security for the due performance of the decree. 
In the case of Patrick Ngetakimanzi vs Marcus Mutuamuluvi & 2 Others- High Court Election Petition No. 8 of 2013 it was held as follows;
“Security of costs ensures that the respondent is not left without recompense for any costs or charges payable to him. The duty of the court is therefore to create a level ground for all the parties involved, in this case, the proportionality of the right of the petitioner to access to justice vis-a-vis the respondent's right to have security for any costs that may be owed to him and not to have vexatious proceedings brought against him.”
The application dated 6/3/2023 be and is hereby allowed in the following terms.:
THAT stay of execution of the judgment delivered on 24/2/2023 be and is hereby granted pending appeal to the Court of Appeal.
THAT the costs of the application to abide the appeal.

MAJUNE KRAIFO & COMPANY ADVOCATES…3RD RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the judgement of the Magistrate’s court at Webuye in SRMCC No. 186 of 2005 by Hon. C.N Oruo (Rm) delivered on 25th April, 2016)
JUDGEMENT
The appellant was the defendant before the subordinate court after the 1st and 2nd respondents filed a suit against him seeking the recovery of Kshs 158,000/- plus interest at 25% from 2003 to date of filing suit as well as costs of the suit. The 1st and 2nd respondents had sold the appellant six parcels of land comprised in land parcel no. Ndivisi/Mihuu/211 at the price of Kshs 360,000/-. They alleged that the appellant paid a total of Kshs 202,000/- leaving a balance of Kshs 158,000/-.
The appellant in his statement of defence averred that he had paid the full consideration as the balance of Kshs 158,000/- was deposited with the advocates for the 1st and 2nd respondents.
The 3rd respondent who was admitted as the third party filed its statement of defence and disputed that the amount of Kshs 158,000/- was owing. According to the 3rd respondent, the correct amount owing to the 2nd respondent was Kshs 145,000/- on the grounds that he received Kshs 20,000/- from the 3rd respondent.
After an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate entered judgment in favour of the 1st and 2nd respondents against the appellant for Kshs 158,000/- being the outstanding balance of the purchase price plus interest at 14%.
The appellant is aggrieved by the finding of the subordinate court and thus challenged the same on the following grounds:",court,55.14%,model
"That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in allowing the 1st and 2nd respondent’s claim when the same had not been proved on a balance of probability as required by law.
That the learned trial magistrate erred both in law and in fact in holding that interest be calculated at the rate of 14% from the date of default contrary to the evidence on record.
That the learned trial magistrate erred both in law and in fact in holding that any payments made by the appellant to the 3rd respondent were meant for other purposes when it was clear from the evidence on record that the appellant’s evidence was not challenged by the 3rd respondent who chose not to offer any evidence.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by failing to consider and analyse the evidence of the appellant against the 3rd respondent.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact when it held that the 3rd respondent did not file any pleadings when it was clear from the record that the 3rd respondent filed his statement of defence in court on 19th April 2006.
The learned trial magistrate did not fairly analyse the evidence of the appellant vis-à-vis the testimony of the 2nd respondent.
The learned trial magistrate misapprehended the entire claim of the appellant against the 3rd respondent.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. The appellant filed his submissions on 21/8/2023 while the respondents have not filed any submissions as at the time of writing this judgement.
The appellant in his submissions argues that there existed no advocate-client relationship between the appellant and the 3rd respondent. The appellant denied that it instructed the 3rd respondent to act for him in any case and asserted that the money sent to them was to be transmitted to the 1st and 2nd respondents. The 3rd respondent did not provide any evidence to account for the money they claimed were fees for legal services.  The appellant contends that the 3rd party did not prove its case as required under section 107 of the Evidence Act. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to consider the evidence that was produced by the appellant which showed the 3rd respondent received money on behalf of his clients and that he failed to establish that there existed no advocate-client relationship between the said parties.",court,56.78%,model
"They also advanced that the appellant was clear in his evidence that he paid all the balance of the purchase price to the 3rd respondent who was to remit the same to the 1st and 2nd respondents. The 1st and 2nd respondents admitted in their plaint that they were aware that the appellant deposited the purchase price and that the appellant tendered evidence showing that he deposited the money with the 3rd respondent. There was no evidence by the 3rd respondent to show that they had received instructions from the appellant.
Analysis and determination
As a first appellate court, this court’s role is to subject the whole of the evidence to a fresh and exhaustive scrutiny and make its own conclusions about it, bearing in mind that it did not have the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses first-hand. This duty was well stated in Selle & Another v Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd. & Others (1968) EA 123 in the following terms:
“I accept counsel for the respondent’s proposition that this court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate the evidence or if the impression based on the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally (Abdul Hammed Saif v Ali Mohamed Sholan (1955), 22 E.A.C.A. 270).",court,55.19%,model
"Emmanuel Situma Sikanga (Pw1) testified that he sold to the appellant 6 acres of land for Kshs 360,000/- and was paid Kshs 195,000/-. He was later paid Kshs. 7,000/- but he is yet to receive the balance of Kshs 158,000/-. He testified that he is yet to receive money from the 3rd defendant. On cross-examination, he testified that on 22/2/2003 he was given money by the appellant in the presence of the 3rd respondent. He could not tell what the Kshs 53,000/- paid by the appellant to the 3rd defendant was for and he neither knew what the Kshs 249,000/- was for.  
Kingsley Mutali Sekapchanga (Dw1) testified that he entered into an agreement with the 1st and 2nd respondents for the purchase of 6 acres of land and upon execution Kshs 195,000/- was paid. He deposited money to the 3rd respondent as part payment, on 17/2/2003. The 3rd respondent was acting for the 1st and 2nd respondents and that the title of the land was being held as surety in court. Dw1 later made two deposits of Kshs 25,400/- on 27/2/2003 and later on Kshs 298,000/-. Kshs 90,000/- was paid to Mary Naliaka, a sister to the 1st and 2nd respondent. Dw1 testified that he deposited money to the 3rd respondent’s account which monies were to be remitted to the 2nd respondent. On cross-examination, he testified that he had a client-advocate relationship with the 3rd respondent. He maintained that he paid professional fees but did not have proof of payment.
I have considered the submissions and the evidence on record. It is not in dispute that the 1st and 2nd respondents were paid Kshs 195,000/- upon execution of the contract and further Kshs 7,000/- on 2/1/2005. The only dispute relates to the payment of the balance of the purchase price being Kshs. 158,000/-.",court,53.38%,model
"There was no evidence that the balance of Kshs 158,000/- was paid to the 1st and 2nd respondents. The appellant testified that he deposited money with the 3rd respondent for onward transmission of the same to the 1st and 2nd respondents. 
The 3rd respondent acted for the appellant, 1st and 2nd respondent. Pw1 testified that the title to the land was in the custody of the court and was released after the appellant and the 3rd respondent posted cash bail. Dexh1 revealed that the appellant paid Kshs 53,000/- through the 3rd respondent on 17/2/2003.   Dw1 also testified that there existed a client-advocate relationship with the 3rd respondent. At the time of execution of the sale agreement, the appellant had paid Kshs 195,000/- leaving a balance of Kshs 165,000/-.
Dw1 produced Dexh 1, 2 and 3 all showing that he deposited money with the 3rd respondent. Immediately after the parties signed the agreement, the appellant deposited Kshs 25,400 on 27/2/2003 into the 3rd respondent’s account and later on 5/03/2003, he further deposited Kshs 248,000/-. He explained that Kshs 25,000/- was for the survey costs. This therefore left the 3rd respondent with a balance of Kshs 248,000/- and according to Dw1, the 3rd respondent was to remit the balance of the purchase price to the 1st and 2nd respondents.",court,52.06%,model
"The 3rd respondent filed its statement of defence but did not present any evidence to challenge the evidence of the appellant. The evidence of the appellant therefore remained uncontroverted. After a comprehensive examination of the evidence, I find that the 3rd respondent (third party) failed to transfer the funds that the appellant had deposited into its account to the 1st and 2nd respondent. In my view, the sole responsibility for settling the remaining balance of the purchase price, amounting to Kshs 158,000/-, should rest squarely on the shoulders of the 3rd respondent who was the advocate for the vendors. In any case, the 3rd Respondent (Third Party) confirmed in its statement of defence and evidence that it had acted for the vendors in the transaction.   As the appellant had successfully enjoined the law firm as a third party and having proved that he duly deposited the sums in question with the third party, it was thus erroneous for the learned trial magistrate to hold that the sums had been paid in respect of legal fees. Consequently, I find the decision arrived at was erroneous and must be interfered with.
In the result, I find merit in the appeal. The same is allowed. The judgement of the trial court dated 25/4/2016 is hereby set aside and in its place, judgment is entered for 1st and 2nd respondents against the 3rd respondent (third party) in the sum of Kshs 158,000/-at 14%P.a from the date of default. The appellant shall have costs of the appeal as against the 3rd respondent while the 1st and 2nd Respondents will have costs in the lower court to be borne by the 3rd Respondent (Third Party).

CIVIL APPEAL NO. E793 OF 2021
BETWEEN

EAGLE GROUP INTERNATIONAL LIMITED ……………………………….. RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the Ruling and Order of Hon. K.O. Gweno, RM/Adjudicator dated 20th September 2021 at the Small Claims Court at Nairobi SCC No. No.40 of 2021)
JUDGMENT
The parties are currently embroiled in proceedings before the Small Claims Court where the Respondent claims to have supplied 345 laptops worth Kshs. 7,762,000.00 to the Appellant for which it paid leaving a balance of Kshs. 762,500.00 which the Respondent seeks. On 20.09.2021, after the close of hearing of the parties’ cases, the Respondent’s counsel orally sought leave of the court to file additional documents. The Appellant’s counsel opposed the application on the ground that both parties had closed their cases and that the Respondent had time to prepare its case and that the Respondent’s counsel ought to have sought for an adjournment. In response, the Respondent’s counsel averred that he was in fact seeking “leave to file a substantive application” and that the Appellant would not be prejudiced with the application since they had the Respondent’s documents.",court,55.68%,model
"By a ruling dated 20.09.2021 (“the Ruling”), the Adjudicator held that the Appellant had not explained how it would be prejudiced if the court allowed the application for additional evidence to be adduced. He noted that the application made was based on the court’s discretion and that the said discretion had to be exercised judiciously. Further, that Article 159(2) of the Constitution enjoined the court dispense substantive justice without undue regard to technicalities and that in this case, the subordinate court had to determine the real issue in controversy. That if the additional evidence would assist the court in arriving at an accurate decision, then it ought to be allowed. The Adjudicator further held that the Appellant would also cross-examine the witness on the said additional documents and in that regard, it made orders re-opening the suit, directing the Appellant to be supplied with the additional documents so that it can defend itself and that the parties were at liberty to call witnesses for purposes of producing the said additional documents and cross-examination.
The Appellant is dissatisfied with the Ruling and appeals to this court based on the amended memorandum of appeal dated 13.07.2022. The appeal has been canvassed by way written submissions. 
In its submissions, the Appellant raises the following issues for determination. First, whether the Smalls Claims Court can order re-opening of a matter once both parties have closed their case. If so, under what circumstances. It also asks whether the court should be moved by a formal application and whether both parties must substantially be heard before the court can make a finding. 
The Small Claims Court Act, 2016 (“the SCCA”) and the Small Claims Court Rules, 2019 (“the Rules”) are silent on whether the Small Claims Court has the power to order for re-opening of a case once both parties have testified and closed their respective cases. The parties agree that the decision on whether or not to allow a party to re-open its case and to adduce additional evidence is a matter of discretion. In this respect the court is guided by the principles set out at section 3 of the SCCA that is; timely disposal of all proceeding using the least expensive method, equal opportunity to access judicial services, fairness of process and simplicity of procedure.",court,56.63%,model
"Further, under section 17 of the SCCA, the court is empowered to control its own procedure in determination of claims before it and in exercise of that control, the court shall have regard to the rules of natural justice. This provision is echoed by the Rules which at Rule 31 provides that in conduct of proceedings the Court shall not be bound by the strict rules of procedure and evidence. 
The totality of the provisions I have cited means that the High Court in exercising appellate jurisdiction must be alive to the general objective of the Small Claims Court and avoid being too prescriptive in its decisions to the extent of undermining the essence of the Small Claims Court.
This appeal concerns the exercise of discretion by the Adjudicator. This court is guided by the principle settled in Mbogo v Shah [1968] EA 93 that an appellate court will not interfere with the decision of the trial court unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his discretion has misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision, or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been an injustice. Thus, when Adjudicator considers an application to reopen a case and for leave to adduce additional evidence, it must act judiciously by allowing and granting the parties an opportunity to make their case to the fullest extent bearing in mind the principles articulated in the SCCA and underpinned by Article 159(2)(d) of the Constitution which commands the court to eschew procedural technicalities.",court,57.62%,model
"Having read the record, I hold the Adjudicator erred in failing to grant the Respondent an opportunity to make its case. The Respondent requested for an opportunity to make a formal application. While I accept that oral and informal applications are allowed, a formal application allows a party to put its case fully before the court and permits the other party to respond. The Respondent sought the leave of the court to file a substantive application which I believe would have included the information/documents sought to be adduced and would have assisted the court determine their relevance. The court would thus be in a better position to make a judicious decision as to whether to reopen the case and admit the additional evidence. Rendering the Ruling without allowing the substantive application to be filed first also denied the Appellant the opportunity to substantively reply to the said application thereby occasioning it prejudice. In addition, the court did not interrogate why the said additional evidence was not called earlier on at the hearing as such an interrogation was necessary and relevant at that stage to once again inform the trial court’s discretion. Failure to interrogate this and proceeding to make the Ruling was a misapprehension and abuse of the trial court’s discretion.
I also do not think that the constrained timeline of the Small Claims Court is an impediment to the Adjudicator permitting a formal application since the court and parties are aware of timelines embedded in the SCCA and the Adjudicator is empowered to give appropriate directions. 
For the reasons I have given, I allow the appeal. I remand the matter to the Small Claims Court to give direction on the Respondent’s request to file a formal application bearing in mind the considerations I have made and in particular the timelines. 
Given the nature of the appeal, each party shall bear its own costs.

Before Court is the application dated 16/3/2023. The same was brought under sections 1A, 1B & 3A of the Civil Procedure Act, section 7 of the appellate jurisdiction Act, Order 50 rules 1 and 6 of the Civil Procedure rules.  
The application sought for the extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal against the judgment of this Court delivered on 30/9/2022. That the notice of appeal already filed be deemed to be as duly filed.
In support of the application, the applicant relied on the grounds on the face of it and on the supporting affidavit of James K Muthui sworn on 16/3/2023. It was the applicant’s contention that the Court dismissed its case on 30/9/2022 and it intended to appeal against that decision.",court,56.35%,model
"In explaining the delay, it was averred that the advocate who had the conduct of the matter had not filed the notice of appeal although she had informed the applicant’s counsel that the same had been filed together with the request for proceedings. That upon discovery of the failure to file, the applicant filed the notice of appeal on 14/3/2023 without further delay. It was averred that the appeal was arguable and the applicant would suffer great injustice if the orders sought are not granted. That the delay was not intended and was not inordinate and the error of the advocate should not be visited on the client.
The 1st defendant opposed the application vide a replying affidavit of Chrispine Owiye sworn on 19/4/2023. It was averred that the plaintiff had not served the 1st defendant on time as required by Rule 75(2) of the Court of Appeal Rules. That no good or sufficient cause was provided to explain the delay in filing the notice of appeal. It was contended that the delay of 6 months was inordinate and that the draft memorandum of appeal annexed to the application did not disclose an arguable appeal. The application was termed as incompetent and an abuse to the court process.
On their part, the 2nd to 5th defendant filed a response to the application via a replying affidavit sworn on 10/5/2023 by EDWIN M MUKELE. He averred that the defendants were served with the notice of appeal on 20/3/2023, 6 months after the judgment was delivered. 
According to him, there had been no sufficient cause for failing to serve the notice within the stipulated timelines. That 6months delay was inordinate and inexcusable and the defendants would suffer great prejudice if the orders sought are granted.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions which have been considered.
The applicant submitted that it was deserving of the orders sought as the delay in filing the notice of appeal was caused by an error of the part of the Counsel who had the conduct of the matter. That upon discovery of the error, the applicant’s advocates had acted promptly without any further delay and the interest of justice would dictate granting the orders sought.",court,56.30%,model
"It was further submitted that the delay was not inordinate or intentional as it was caused by error of Counsel. That the appeal raised matters of general public importance and the applicants would not suffer any prejudice that cannot not be compensated by costs.
It was submitted for the respondents that the applicant had not provided any good or sufficient reason for the delay as the applicant ought to have been keen and diligent in following up on its case. That the mere allegation that the mistake was on the part of Counsel was not sufficient enough to invoke the court’s jurisdiction. 
That the delay of five months was inordinate and appeal cannot be said to be of public importance since it involved a private contractual arrangement between the applicant and the 1st defendant.
I have considered the parties’ contestations and the submissions on record. The applicant seeks leave to have the notice of appeal admitted out of time. 
Rule 75 of the Court of Appeal Rules provides: - 
“1.■Any person who desires to appeal to the Court shall give notice in writing, which shall be lodged in duplicate with the registrar of the superior court.
2.■Every such notice shall, subject to rules 84 and 97, be so lodged within fourteen days of the date of the decision against which it is desired to appeal.”
It is not in dispute that judgment in this matter was delivered on 30/9/2022. The notice of appeal was filed on 14/3/2023, nearly six month’s later. 
In Thuita Mwangi v Kenya  Airways [2003] eKLR, the Court of Appeal reiterated its decision in Mutiso v Mwangi  [1997] KLR 630 as follows: -
“It is now well settled that the decision whether or not to extend the time for appealing is essentially discretionary.  It is also well settled that generally the matters which this court takes into account in deciding whether to grant an extension of time are; first, the length of delay; secondly, the reason for the delay; thirdly (possibly) the chances of appeal succeeding if the application is granted; and fourthly, the degree of prejudice to the Respondent of the application is granted.”",court,56.51%,model
"The principles applicable in an application for leave out of time were also considered by the Supreme Court in Nicholas Kiptoo Korir Arap Salat Vs.  IEBC and 7 Others [2014] eKLR as follows: -
“The underlying principles a court should consider in exercise of such discretion include;
1.■Extension of time is not a right of any party.  It is an equitable remedy that is only available to a deserving party at the discretion of the court;
2.■A party who seeks for extension of time has the burden of laying a basis to the satisfaction of the court;
3.■Whether the court should exercise the discretion to extend time, is a consideration to be made a case- to-case basis;
4.■Whether there is a reasonable reason for the delay. The   delay   should be explained to the satisfaction of the court;
5.■Whether there will be any prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted;
6.■Whether the application has been brought without undue delay.
7. ...”
From the foregoing, the Court will have to apply the said principles in determining the present application. These are; the duration of the delay, the reason for the delay, the prejudice that would be occasioned to the respondents and merit of the appeal. 
In the present case, since the judgment was delivered on 30/9/2022, the notice of appeal ought to have been filed by the 14/10/2022. The notice of appeal was however filed on 14/3/2023, meaning a delay of over 5 months. Even if we were to take into consideration the excluded period, under Order 50 rule 4 of between 21/12/2022 and 13/1/2023, in the computation of time, the delay will still be in excess of 4 months. That in my view was in ordinate delay. The same requires an explanation.
In explaining the delay, it was explained that it was the advocate who was conducting the matter who failed to take steps to lodge the appeal. The law firm representing the applicant admitted that the default was attributable to it. It was the applicant’s contention is that the default of its advocates should not be visited upon it.",court,55.03%,model
"The respondents opposed the application on the ground that the delay was inordinate and the reasons advanced by the applicant are not sufficient.
I am of the view that, it is not uncommon that advocates in law firms are susceptible to making grave mistakes. They may fail to report the proper steps taken in a litigation. The question this Court has to answer is, should it let the client pursue an action for professional negligence in those circumstances? My view is that the Court should be very restrained from taking that route. That route should be taken only when it is clear that the delay is so inordinate and to allow an extension it would extremely prejudice the opposite party.
In the present case, the delay was inordinate delay. However, there was no evidence on the part of the respondents that they would be exposed to prejudice that cannot be compensated by an award of costs if the extension sought was granted. 
In the interests of justice, this matter raises very important issues of public interest. What happens where a public entity decides to take a shortcut in favour of a preferred private investor to the exclusion of others? Should the law be applied strictly to prevent the private sector players from enticing public officers and/or entities from engaging in wrongful, irregular and acts that amount to an illegality? These are issues in my view that require to be examined, interrogated on and pronounced in a resounding manner by our esteemed Appellate Court.  
Accordingly, I am inclined to allow the application to give that esteemed Court an opportunity to interrogate the matter. I cannot in my position examine whether or not the intended appeal is arguable having in mind that I am convinced that I was right in my judgment. Talking for myself, the appeal is unarguable. However, that is the role and preserve of the Court of Appeal.
Accordingly, the Court finds merit in the application and hereby allows the same as prayed. However, the applicant shall bear the costs of the application.
It is so ordered.

The claimant filed the Statement of claim on 15.12.2017 through Memusi Micheni & Associates Advocates.  The amended statement of claim was filed on 17.01.2018. The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:

Costs of the suit 
The reply to amended statement of claim was filed on 23.02.2018 through Orina & Co Advocates. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed with costs.",court,53.01%,model
"The claimant’s case was that through a letter dated 30.08.2017, the 2nd respondent being a consultant for a project known as the Western Transmission (Kabete-Uthiru-Karen) Pipeline Lot 2, directed the 1st respondent to employ the claimant, in the twin capacity of site surveyor and technician with effect from 25.08.2017  for a period of twenty months, in accordance with a clause 706 of particulars specifications and item no 3.12 of Bill no. 1 (Preliminaries and General). 
It is the claimant’s case that the 1st respondent disregarded the terms of the subject contract of employment, and put him on half salary until 31.10.2017 when the 2nd respondent’s project manager verbally terminated his employment without lawful cause. 
On the part of the 1st and 2nd respondent it was pleaded that there was a contract between the parties as the claimant was issued with the letter of appointment. The respondents denied that the monthly salary and allowances was Kshs.155,000 as alleged for the claimant. Further, the appointment letter issued to the claimant captured what was verbally agreed between the parties to the tune of Kshs.40,000/= being monthly gross emoluments which amount was accepted by the claimant because it was based on the nature of work to be assigned to him. Further, the respondents admitted receiving that demand letter but did not act on it because it was without basis. They denied the claims and prayers in the amended statement of claim.
The Claimant filed testified to support his case but despite numerous opportunities to call the witness to testify, the respondent failed to do so. The respondent as well failed to file the final submissions.  The Court has considered all the material on record and returns as follows.",court,50.67%,model
"To answer the 1st issue the Court returns that parties were in a contract of service. The claimant was employed by the letter dated 30.08.2017 to work for the Resident Engineer in the project as pleaded for the claimant. The letter shows he was identified by the second respondent for the 1st respondent to be paid Kshs.40,000.00 gross monthly payment less statutory deduction. The employment had taken effect on 25.08.2017. The Court returns that the 1st and 2nd respondents were the joint claimant’s employers.
To answer the 2nd issue and per the claimant’s testimony, his employment was terminated at the end of October 2017. Thus, he worked for the respondents for two months. It was a verbal termination.
The 3rd issue is whether the claimant is entitled to the remedies as prayed for. The Court returns as follows:
The claimant prayed for payment of the claimant’s anticipated salary (to be specified later) and house allowance for 18 months Kshs.47,500 x 18 months =Kshs.855,000.00. The prayer is found speculative and without contractual basis. Parties appear to have agreed upon a gross or consulted monthly payment of Kshs.40,000.00. The claimant has not shown basis of the 18 months and base of monthly house allowance. The prayer will collapse. 
The claimant prayed for payment of the claimant’s unpaid salary for the entire period of his contract of employment (to be specified later) Kshs.107, 500.00 x 20 months =Kshs.2,150,000.00. At the hearing the claimant testified that  he was working for a construction company as an assistant project manager. He did not show how the termination by the respondents or other reason attributable to the respondents had diminished his capacity to thereafter engage gainfully. His evidence was that he had moved on and he was gainfully employed. He did not explain the basis for the 20 years and the Kshs.107,500.00 per month as was pleaded. The prayer will fail",court,51.54%,model
"He prayed for leave pay which was not quantified. The Court finds that he had worked for only 2 months and had not earned leave per section 28 of the Employment Act as he had not worked for an aggregate period of 12 months.
The Court has considered the prayer for general damages for wrongful termination of employment. The termination was without notice and it appears no reason was given. It appears that in view of the service of two months and the factors in section 49 of the Act for award of compensation, one-month payment particularly in lieu of termination notice as envisaged in section 35 of the Act will meet the ends of justice making Kshs.40,000.00. 
No justification was shown for an order directing the Honourable Attorney General or the Cabinet Secretary in charge of labour relations to enforce. The same will be declined.
The claimant has substantially succeeded and is awarded costs of the suit.
In conclusion judgment is hereby entered for the claimant against the 1st and 2nd respondents jointly and severally for:
Payment of Kshs.40,000.00 less PAYE by 31.12.2023 failing interest be payable thereon from the date of this judgment till full payment.
The payment of costs of the suit.

JUDGMENT
Introduction
This matter concerns the forfeiture application over suspicions funds held in the Respondent’s accounts held in Diamond Trust Bank Kenya.
The Respondents account received a huge sum of funds from an account in Mauritius held under a company where the first respondent is a director, where the explanation of the source was found to be unsatisfactory to the Applicant, hence the current proceedings.
The Parties
The Applicant is the Asset Recovery Agency established under Section 53 of the Proceeds of Crime and Anti Money Laundering Act (herein after referred to as POCAMLA] as a body corporate with the mandate of identifying, tracing, freezing and recovering proceeds of crime. The agency has authority to institute civil proceedings for the recovery of proceeds of crime and seek orders for forfeiture of assets to the government where there are reasonable grounds to believe that such assets are proceeds of crime. The agency also has policing powers under Section 53A of the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act to enable it investigate, identify, trace, freeze and recover proceeds of crime.
The 1st Respondent is a British national and the sole director of the 2nd Respondent and is the beneficiary of the funds in account numbers 0512388001 (KSHS), 5512388001 (USD), 0579377002 (USD) held at Diamond Trust Bank. He’s also the sole director and shareholder of the 2nd Respondent and Jossimba Limited which is a company incorporated in Seychelles with an offshore account held at Bank One Limited in Mauritius.
The 2nd Respondent a limited company, holds account number 0579377002 (USD) at Diamond Trust Bank.

The sale had also been conducted in 2017 while the funds were deposited into his account in 2021. He had alleged that the funds from the land sale had been deposited into the advocates accounts in Kenya, wired to Pakistan and invested in Global Gums Limited under a loan agreement earning him 15.5% interest yet he was not the vendor, the loan agreement was not produced and the total funds did not add up to the interest rate.",court,51.94%,model

The Respondent’s case
The Respondents opposed the application in their replying affidavits, all dated 15th June 2023 and sworn by the 1st Respondent. He deposed as follows:
The funds in issue in this matter were sourced from genuine legal business operations.
The Applicant after obtaining freezing orders, had summoned the 1st Respondent for interrogations and he had supplied the agency with the supporting documents demonstrating the source of the funds, how it had been invested and how the funds had eventually accumulated.
On 12/11/2017 his mother and sister sold their shares in Dalton Limited, which owned land, and he had been nominated as a contact person on behalf of the vendors. Kshs. 62 million was paid in the transaction through Kaplan & Stratton Advocates who transferred the funds to Zehra Karim, in Pakistan to be invested in Golden Gums Holding Limited under a loan agreement which would earn the 1st Respondent an interest. He had travelled to Pakistan to inspect the operations of the company which was a member of the chamber of commerce in Pakistan, and correspondence to this effect is attached.
In August 2018, the 1st Respondent incorporated Jossimba Limited in Seychelles where direct deposits from Golden Gums Holding Limited were made as it had accounts in Mauritius. He eventually set up an account in the name of the 2nd Respondent with Bank One in Mauritius for ease of payment.
On 3/2/2020, entered into a further loan agreement through Jossimba Capital Limited with the Global Gum and invested a further 80,000 USD, a further loan agreement for 500,000 USD on 10/2/2020 and 315,000 USD on 28/4/2020. Interest on the loans would be made to Jossimba account. Bank statements attached show various payments received by Jossimba from Global Gum.
Funds received in Jossimba Account would be invested in the stock market in various global companies through Bank One.",court,51.64%,model
"The 2nd Respondent was incorporated in 2019 with its core business being the import and sale of motorbike seat covers which were imported from Pakistan. The funds were sourced from Bank One and were deposited into the 2nd Respondent’s Account at DTB. The seat covers were purchased but did not perform in the market. Payment details for the seat covers has been attached.
In April 2022, the 1st Respondent incorporated AJ Original Spares Company Limited in South Sudan dealing in Motor vehicle spare parts, which was authorized to carry out import and export business. The funds used for the importation of the spare parts came from the 2nd Respondent’s Account. That business has stayed stuck because of the restrictions placed on the subject account by the Applicant herein.
The USD Account at DTB in the name of the 1st Respondent has been inactive since May 2019. All credits into the account were sourced from Josssimba account at Bank One or through direct internal transfer from the 2nd Respondent’s Account in DTB. Payments of USD 100,000 on 25/5/19 was by swift transfer from Jossimba Limited, USD 10,000 from the 2nd Respondent’s USD Account on 28/5/2021, and USD 994,792.90 on 30/7/2021 from Jossimba Account in Mauritius due to closure of the account.
The 1st Respondent’s KSHS. account at DTB became active on 14/5/2019 and all credits into the account were made by the 1st Respondent personally.
The 2nd Respondent’s USD Account with DTB became active on 08/10/2019 and all credits were through the 1st Respondent’s USD account at DTB and Jossimba Account in Mauritius.
The closure of the Mauritius account was due to introduction of legislative regulations which affected the Bank’s internal policy requiring the Respondent to close his accounts by 10/2/2021. The funds were forwarded through JP Morgan Chase Bank New York merely as a clearing Bank.",court,51.04%,model
"Bank One in Mauritius is subject to the Financing Intelligence and Anti-Money Laundering Act which required the Bank to report any suspicious transactions and not seek closure of the accounts. The Bank issued a closure notice on 9/2/21 and agreed to extend the period by over 4 months, showing that it was not de-risking as that would have called for immediate dissociation from the Bank. No report was ever lodged by the Bank to report suspicious activities on the Respondent’s account.
The suggestion that the funds are connected to the 1st Respondent’s father Ryan Cornelius is absurd as he was arrested in Dubai in 2008, when the 1st Respondent was 17 years old, and has been in custody ever since. The arrest was found to be arbitrary by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the allegations that the 1st Respondent’s funds are connected to the arrest are baseless.
The applicant’s application is based on mere suspicion yet the source of funds had been adequately explained. The Applicant had confirmed that it had verified and confirmed the authenticity of the documents issued in Kenya.
He Applicant also had the legal power to liaise with the Financial Intelligence Unit in Mauritius and Pakistan on suspicion of money laundering but it did not. Despite this, no credible evidence has been placed before this court to demonstrate illegality.
The 1st Respondent denied any averments to the Applicant that the Mauritius account was closed because he needed a Kenyan Visa. He had merely indicated that to get an investor’s visa, he was required to have a Bank account with minimum USD 100,000, which had been specifically quarried by the agency.
He had also not said at any time that the proceeds from the share transfer were deposited in his account. Kaplan and Stratton remitted the funds to Zehra Karim, the representative of Global Gums on the basis of the loan agreement.
The 1st Respondent has annexed the Certificate to authenticate the electronic records presented to Court.
The Plaintiff’s submissions",court,52.01%,model
"The Plaintiff’s submissions
The applicant submitted that the 1st Respondent was not a director or shareholder of Dalton Limited and was thus not privy to the share transfer agreement from which he claims to have sourced the capital. No evidence of authority to transact in the funds was tabled. The company had 5000 shares with a nominal value of Kshs 20 each with a share capital of Kshs. 100,000 yet it was sold for Kshs. 62 Million.
The activities of Dalton Company prior to its sale have not been demonstrated to this court. Investigations showed no record of any activities being undertaken by the company to support its growth to purchase the said property.
No evidence was provided to show the movement of funds from the purchaser to the vendor in the transaction.
The 1st Respondent had averred that he had never met the supposed buyers of the property. The buyers were also untraceable to the applicant. The source of Kshs. 62 million remains unexplained.
There is no proof of direct transfer of funds from the 1st Respondent to Global Gums Limited and no explanation why the funds were received by an individual as opposed to the company. There’s also no proof that the money received by Zehra Karim was eventually transferred to Global Gums Limited. The loan agreement provided was signed in Dubal and the names and designation of the persons signing on behalf of Global Gums Limited is missing.
The three loan agreements with Global Gums Limited within a span of two months fail to show the source of the funds being invested.
The interest schedules to the loan agreement has not been presented leading to conclusion that the transaction is fictional.
There has not been any evidence of income generating activities of Jossimba Limited whose account was held in Mauritius. The money generated from trading in stock, being from an unexplained source would make the money earned from the stock trade also proceeds of crime.
The 1st Respondent admitted that the business for which the 2nd Respondent was set up for did not kick off and he is still in possession of the merchandise yet the account of the 2nd Respondent received USD 40,680.16 whose source is unknown. He has also failed to explain how the 2nd Respondent which was not generating income was able to fund a spare parts company in South Sudan.",court,52.66%,model
"The Applicant submitted that money launders usually create complex schemes to camouflage and conceal assets and benefits from criminal activities just as the 1st Respondent had moved money from jurisdiction to another with the aim of legitimizing it through legal financial systems.
The Applicant contends that the closure of the Jossimba Limited account by Bank One in Mauritius was as a result of de-risking as banks would not want to lose such huge deposits.
It submits that the inconsistencies exhibited by the 1st Respondent are satisfactory to warrant forfeiture of the proceeds of crime to the state.
The Applicant submits that the funds that are subject in this matter are proceeds of crime and should thus be forfeited to the state. This court has power under section 92(1) to issue orders of forfeiture if it finds on a balance of probabilities, reasonable grounds to establish that the funds are proceeds of crime.
The Applicant relied on the following cases in their submissions:
Agricultural Finance Corporation -v- Lengitia Limited (1985) KLR 765

The Respondent’s submissions",court,53.75%,model
"The Respondent’s submissions 
The Respondents submitted that the 1st Respondent is a man of great business acumen with the capacity to identify opportunities globally who grew his wealth from a capital of Kshs. 62,000,000 which was USD 440,000 in 2017. The 1st Respondent annexed the share purchase agreement as well as his birth certificate to demonstrate that Heather Anne Cornelius is indeed his mother. He submitted that the consideration for the share transfer was deposited in the Kaplan & Stratton Advocates bank account who then conveyed it in form of USD to a representative of Global Gums Limited pursuant to a loan agreement between the 1st Respondent and Global Gums Ltd. The remittance of the Advocates was also annexed. The 1st Applicant  also argued that the Share purchase agreement recognized him as the contact person on behalf for his mother and sister; that the Applicant had confirmed that they had authenticated the documents issued in Kenya. The Respondent reasonably expected the Applicant to reach out to Kaplan & Stratton Advocates to authenticate the details of the transaction. The Applicant has not tabled any evidence from the firm to suggest that the transaction was not genuine.
All of the Respondent’s businesses were conducted in countries which are signatories to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and the Eastern and Southern African Anti-Money Laundering Group.
Dalton Limited had been incorporated in the year 1990 and it owned an asset known as Sub-Division Number Group V/443. Share transfer includes the transfer of interest in the assets owned by a company. The agency did not show any documentary evidence that the share transfer was nit effected at the Companies Registry. 
The Claim that the purchasers of the shares were untraceable is also unfounded as they were represented by Kaplan & Stratton Advocates and there has been no evidence that attempts to trace them through the firm were futile.
The Applicant’s suspicions are based on a mere misunderstanding of the Respondents’ business model.
The source of the Respondents’ capital has been explained through documentation and the eventual accumulation through legal businesses.
The Agency has failed to table the report compiled through correspondence with Interpol on the nature of businesses carried out by the 1st Respondent in the other countries leading to a reasonable inference that there was no illegality.

The Issues for determination
Whether the Respondent’s funds held in accounts numbers  0512388001 (KSH), 5512388001 (USD) and 0579377002 (USD) at Diamond Trust Bank are proceeds of crime liable to forfeiture.
Who shall bear the costs of these proceedings?
Analysis and Determination 
Issue (i) - Whether the Respondent’s funds held in accounts numbers 0512388001 (KSH), 5512388001 (USD) and 0579377002 (USD) at Diamond Trust Bank are proceeds of crime liable to forfeiture
Section 92(1) of the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act enjoins this court to order forfeiture if it is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the property is proceeds of crime of instrumentality of crime.
Section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act  defined proceeds of crime to mean “any property or economic advantage derived or realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of or in connection with an offence irrespective of the identity of the offender and includes, on a proportional basis, property into which any property derived or realized directly form the offence was later successively converted, transformed or intermingled, as well as income, capital or other economic gains or benefits derived or realized from such property from the time the offence was committed.”",court,52.08%,model
"The threshold for proof is therefore on a balance of probabilities and the legal burden falls on the Assets Recovery Agency.
It is also evident from a reading of Section 92(4) of the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act  that to succeed, the Applicant need not prove  the commission of a specific offence.
This was explained as follows in the case of Director of Assets Recovery and Others v Green & Others [2005] EW HC 3168 where the court stated:-
“In civil proceedings for recovery under parts of the Act the Director need not allege the Commission of any specific criminal offence but must set out the matters that are alleged to constitute the particular kind or kinds of unlawful conduct by or in return for which the property was obtained.”
Similarly, in the case of Assets Recovery Agency & Others v Audrene Samantha Rowe & others Civil Division Claim NO. 2012 H CV 02120 the court held:-
“.... that in deciding whether the matters alleged constituted unlawful conduct when a civil recovery order is being made is to be decided on a balance of probability, civil recovery proceedings are directed at the seizure of property and not the conviction of any individual and thus there was no reason to apply the criminal standard of proof.”
Further in the Namimbian case of Tekla Nandjila Lameck v President of Namimbia  2012 (1) NR 255 (HC) it was held:
“.......Asset forfeiture is, as is stated in Section 50 of POCA, a civil remedy directed at confiscation of the  proceeds of crime and not at punishing an accused.  Chapter 6  proceedings are furthermore not necessarily related to a prosecution of an accused.  Those proceedings  are open to the state to invoke whether or not there is a criminal prosecution.
..... even if there is a prosecution, the remedy is not affected by the outcome of the criminal proceedings.  The remedy is thus directed at the proceeds and instrumentalities of crime and not at the person having possession of them. This is in furtherance of the fundamental purpose of these procedures referred to above.”
Closer home it was held as follows in the case of Abdulrahman Mahmoud Sheikh & 6 Others v Republic & Others [2016] eKLR: -",court,55.67%,model
"“The  letter, spirit purpose, and gravamen of the  Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act is to ensure that one doesn’t benefit from criminal  conduct and that should any proceeds of criminal conduct be traced, then it ought to be forfeited, after due process, to the state, on behalf of the public which is deemed to have suffered some injury by the criminal conduct.”
It is also now well settled that in civil application for forfeiture whereas the Applicant bears the legal burden of proof when the applicant discharges that burden the evidential burden shifts to the Respondent (s) to prove that the property was lawfully obtained. This is as was held by the Kenya Court of Appeal in the case of Stanley Mombo Amuti v Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission [209] eKLR albeit  ruling on forfeiture under the Anti-Corruption & Economic Crimes Act (ACECA) held:- 
“76.■The trial court in considering this submission at paragraph 92 of its judgment expressed that a claim for civil recovery of unexplained assets can be determined on the basis of conduct in relation to property without identification of any particular unlawful conduct; that in the instant matter, the respondent was not required to prove the appellant actually committed an act of corruption in order to invoke the provisions of ACECA. The learned judge cited dicta from the case of Director of Assets Recovery Agency & others -v- Green & Others [2005] EWHC 3168 where it was stated:
“In civil proceedings for recovery under Part 5 of the Act, the Director need not allege the commission of specific criminal offence but must set out the matters that are alleged to constitute the particular kind or kinds of unlawful conduct by or in return for which the property was obtained.”
77. ■We have considered the appellant’s contestation that no allegation of corrupt conduct or abuse of office has been leveled against him and that he has never been charged or convicted of an offence under the ACECA.",court,55.16%,model
"78. ■The concept of “unexplained assets” and its forfeiture under Sections 26 and 55 (2) of ACECA is neither founded on criminal proceedings nor conviction for a criminal offence or economic crime. Sections 26 and 55 of ACECA are non-conviction based civil forfeiture provisions. The Sections are activated as an action in rem against the property itself. The Sections require the Anti- Corruption Commission to prove on balance of probability that an individual has assets disproportionate to his/her legitimately known sources of income. Section 55 (2) of the Act make provision for evidentiary burden which is cast upon the person under investigation to provide satisfactory explanation to establish the legitimate origin of his/her assets. This evidentiary burden is a dynamic burden of proof requiring one who is better able to prove a fact to be the one to prove it. Section 55 (2) of ACECA is in sync with Section 112 of the Evidence Act, Cap 80 of the Laws of Kenya. Section 112 of the Evidence Act, (Cap 80 of the Laws of Kenya) provides:
“In civil proceedings when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any party to those proceedings the burden of proving or disproving that fact is upon him.”
■
A similar finding was reached in the Jamaican case of Assets Recovery Agency v Fisher, Rohan and Miller, Delores, Supreme Court of Jamaica, Claim No. 2007 HCV003259 where it was observed: -
“........ Even though these proceedings are quasi criminal in nature there is an evidential burden of proof on the defendant.  It is incumbent on them to demonstrate evidentially now they lawfully came into possession of the assets seized.......”",court,54.97%,model
"In this case the Applicant’s contention that the impugned funds are proceeds of crime is premised on the ground that the 1st Respondent had transferred the funds from one jurisdiction to another before finally moving them to the Diamond Trust Bank.  It is the Applicant’s contention that the conduct of moving the money from one jurisdiction to another was a money laundering scheme and a means to disguise its real source. The 1st Respondent admitted that before transferring the funds to the impugned accounts at the Diamond Trust Bank he had moved the money to Pakistan and Mauritius.  It was his evidence that as a matter of fact he moved the funds to Kenya as a result of the Bank One Limited in Mauritius insisting that he move the funds due to what the bank claimed was a change in its rules. The Applicant however contends that the Mauritius Bank One Ltd was de-risking which is one of the means by which a bank disengages with customer especially if they are high risk for money laundering under the international anti-money laundering framework. It is also the Applicant’s contention that the 1st Respondent’s explanation for moving the funds in the manner that he did was inconsistent.
Section 91(4) of the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act recognizes that such funds may not be directly traced to a specific crime.   The movement of money by the 1st Respondent, registration of different companies in the jurisdictions where he traded with those funds and the sheer amount of those funds would warrant an explanation form the Respondents as to the source of funds.  It is my finding therefore that the Applicant has discharged its legal burden on a balance of probabilities hence shifting the evidential burden to the Respondents to prove that the funds were acquired lawfully. This is after all the position as espoused by Section 112 of the Evidence Act which states: -
■
“112. Proof of special knowledge in civil proceedings
In civil proceedings, when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any party to those proceedings, the burden of proving or disproving that fact is upon him.”",court,53.50%,model
"The 1st Respondent’s case is that the source of the funds was the sale of his mother and sister’s shares in a company known as Dalton Limited.  He annexed a Sale Agreement dated 13th November 2017 between Heather Anne Cornelius and Natasha Cornelius (His mother and sister respectively) on the one hand and Thomas Morton and Emma Morton on the other hand.  It was his evidence that the consideration for the share was Kshs. 62,000,000/- and that was the money he invested and grew to the impugned funds.  He averred that the sale of the share was done through the firm of Kaplan & Stratton Advocates which then transmitted the funds to a company known as Global Gums Holdings Ltd with who he had entered into a loan agreement.  He explained that the loans agreements with Global Gum Holdings Ltd was extended severally and when it transpired that the bank in Pakistan could not pay him interest, he opened another company – Jossimba Ltd in Seychelles – through which the proceeds of the investments in Global Gums Holdings Ltd were subsequently remitted. After that the funds would be paid into the account of the 2nd Respondent in Bank One, Mauritius where Global Gums Ltd has an account. That continued until Bank One gave him notice to close the account.  He denied that Bank One was de-risking and gave reasons for so stating.
This court has no reason to doubt that the 1st Respondent is a man of great business acumen.  Indeed, this is demonstrated in the manner in which he invested the funds. However, the crux of this case is not the capital gains of income from the funds but the source of those funds out of which the income and capital gains were accumulated.",court,52.18%,model
"I have carefully considered the 1st Respondent’s claim that the source of the funds was the sale of his mother and sister’s share in Dalton Limited.  I am however not persuaded that that is the case.  To begin with there is no evidence of completion of the agreement in accordance with Clause 5 and hence payment of the consideration  to the vendors by the purchasers.  The 1st Respondent did not also adduce evidence of payment of the sum of Kshs. 62 million to the firm of  Kaplan & Stratton by the vendors.  There is therefore no proof that the sum of 4400 USD paid to Global Gums Holding Ltd by Kaplan & Stratton was the proceeds of this sale agreement.
Moreover, Clause 4 of the Sale Agreement contained a condition precedent which had to be fulfilled before transfer of the company could take place.   There is no evidence that the said condition precedent was either fulfilled or waived in writings provided in Clause 4.4. of the agreement.
Further Clause 11 of the agreement expressly stated that the rights of the parties to the agreement could not be assigned without their prior written consent.  There is no evidence that the 1st Respondent’s mother and sister had through a prior written consent(s) assigned their rights to the Respondent as would have authorized Kaplan and Stratton to transfer the purchase price to Global Gums Holdings Limited as alleged by the 1st Respondent. The affidavits annexed by the 1st Respondent to the effect that his mother authorized him to invest the funds were sworn on 13th June 2023 during the pendency of these proceedings and clearly the same could not have been made in relation to the sale agreement.  It is also instructive that the agreement only appointed the 1st Respondent as the person to receive any notice demand or other communication on behalf of the purchasers – see Clause 13.1.  nowhere was he appointed as their agent to deal with their funds. So again the funds he dealt with  could not have been proceeds from that agreement.  In the premises I find that the 1st Respondent has not given a plausible explanation for the source of funds found in his account.  He has not, in other words, discharged the evidential burden placed upon him by Section 112 of the Evidence Act.",court,53.83%,model
"The facts and circumstances of this case are distinguishable from the case of Assets Recovery Agency v Bala (Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Civil Suit E005 of 2021) [2021] KEHC 11829 (KLR) because in that case the preserved  funds were found in the Respondent’s physical possession at the airport Section 12 of the Proceeds  of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act requires that such funds  should have been declared at the port of departure which the Respondent had done and so this court found that  for the Applicant to have succeeded it ought to have  adduced evidence to prove  that the funds were tainted.
It is my finding that in this case the Applicant has proved on a balance of probabilities that the Respondents had funds in their accounts which could not be explained other than on the basis that it was the proceeds of a money laundering scheme. The income and capital gains accruing from the funds are also proceeds of crime.
In the upshot I find that the Applicant has proved its case on a balance of probabilities and accordingly I enter judgment for the applicant against the Respondents and grant orders as follows: -
THAT an order be and is hereby issued declaring that the funds held in the Respondents' bank accounts as listed here below are proceeds of crime liable for forfeiture to the Applicant;

The memorandum of response was filed on 14.07.2022 through Obura Mbeche & Company Advocates. The respondent prayed that the suit be dismissed in its entirety with costs to the respondent. 
The claimant’s case was that he was employed by the respondent as a machine operator from 09.01.2017 up to 15.03.2022 when his services were unlawfully terminated by the respondent. 
The claimant states that at the time of the termination of his employment, he was earning a basic salary of Kshs.106,542/=. 
The claimant states that during his employment with the respondent, a period of five years, he was a diligent and committed employee and never received a warning letter.",court,53.52%,model
"That on the night of 02.03.2022 he was on night shift when an accident occurred past 10:30 pm. That while he was picking glucose from a rack by moving the machine called Walk Behind, the tank tipped sideways to the left hand side and fell to the ground. The claimant states that he reported the incident to his line manager, one Madam Christine, who advised that he takes photographs and sends the same to her. 
The claimant states that with the help of the night shift manager, one Madam Janet, they secured the fallen tank and confirmed that there was no spillage or damage to the same and the glucose was then taken to an area called the Hot box. 
The claimant pleaded that the incident was an accident, and that despite his written explanation, the respondent proceeded to terminate his services. 
On the part of the respondents it is admitted that the claimant was an employee of the respondent, however, it is stated that he earned a monthly basic salary of Kshs 53,271 and a monthly house allowance of Kshs.10,609.63. 
That on 02.03.2022 while on night shift duty, the claimant was involved in a safety incident at the raw material warehouse where he tempered with ideal working conditions before undertaking movement of 1.3T glucose resulting in topping of a pallet of glucose 39 from the walk behind owing to the unsafe working conditions. 
That arising from that incident the claimant was invited to show cause by way of the respondent’s letter dated 07.03.2022 as preliminary investigations had revealed that the claimant had intentionally switched off the lights in the area before undertaking the activity. 
That the claimant tendered his written response on 08.03.2022 admitting to switching off the lights in the incident area before undertaking transfer of the glucose which action was in breach of the established respondent’s incorporated, level 2, SES: SES Guideline. 
That as a consequence the claimant was issued with a letter dated 08.03.2022 inviting him to a disciplinary hearing which was held on 09.03.2022, where he was accorded an opportunity to be heard.",court,51.01%,model
"That thereafter his employment was terminated effective 15.03.2022. with the responded computing and paying his terminal dues at the sum of Kshs.378,229.33. 
That at the time of termination the claimant had an ongoing bank loan of Kshs.534,793.70 and the respondent deducted the monthly payment of Kshs.28,828. 
The respondent maintains that the claimant’s termination was lawful, procedural and for justifiable reason. 
The parties filed their respective submissions. The Court has considered the parties’ respective cases and makes finding as follows.
To answer the 1st issue, the Court returns that the parties were in a contract of service.
To answer the 2nd issue, the Court returns that the contract of service was terminated by the letter dated 15.03.2022.",court,52.02%,model
"To answer the 3rd issue, the Court returns that the termination was not unfair both in procedure and substance. In particular, the claimant received the show cause letter, he responded, he attended the disciplinary hearing and the letter of termination followed. Due procedure of a notice and a hearing per section 41 of the Act was accorded to the claimant per section 41 of the Employment Act, 2007. In the letter dated 08.03.2022 the claimant admitted allowing unauthorised persons to access to a restricted area and further, in his testimony, he admitted switching off lights. He is found to have indeed breached the operating standards as was alleged and leading to his dismissal. He confirmed switching off some of the lights in an area of operation but. the operating standards as prescribed, required such an area not to have partial lighting. He confirmed that he had thereby breached the operating standard not to switch off the lights and for the area to be well lit with the light from the lights, some of which he had switched off. After the accident, he admitted in his testimony that his line manager accessed the restricted area but without the prescribed written permission. He also confirmed that prior to the Manager accessing another person known as Richard had also accessed the area in breach of the operating standard as Richard had no written permission or permit. He then testified that it was his obligation to issue access permits but he had not signed and completed the permit form he had initially given to Richard prior to the accident. He dropped prayer for terminal dues as they had been paid. Further, he testified that he had not performed his duties on discussing with his team of five (5) members and signing the risk assessment document per operating standards. The Court finds that the reason for termination was not unfair as envisaged in section 43 of the Act as it related to the claimant’s contact, compatibility and the beach of the respondent’s operational requirements.
The 4th issue is on remedies. No submissions were made for the claimant to specifically justify the remedies as claimed and prayed for. As urged for the respondent, none is justified.
The claimant’s suit has failed and is liable to dismissal with costs.
In conclusion judgement is hereby entered for the respondent against the claimant for dismissal of the suit with costs; and, the Deputy Registrar to cause the court file returned to the Machakos Sub-Registry forthwith.",court,51.13%,model

COMMERCIAL AND TAX DIVISION
INCOME TAX APPEAL NO E011 OF 2022
COMMISSIONER OF DOMESTIC TAXES ………………. APPELLANT
VERSUS -
LUCAS WAITHAKA GITERE ……………………………. RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the judgment of the Tax Appeals Tribunal dated 3rd December 2021 in Tax Appeals Tribunal Number 341 of 2019)
J U D G M E N T
The appellant carried out an investigation on the affairs of the respondent for the years 2016 and 2017. He noted that the respondent had 34 KPLC meters which, according to the appellant, meant that the respondent had 34 rental houses. 
Based on this information, the appellant raised an assessment of Kshs. 803,311/- which comprised of principal tax of Kshs. 644,248.80 and penalties of Kshs 34,212.44. The respondent objected to the assessment on 24/4/2019 which the appellant rejected vide an objection decision dated 21/6/2019.
Aggrieved by the appellant’s decision, the respondent lodged an appeal at the Tax Appeals Tribunal which allowed the appeal on 3/12/2021.  
Aggrieved that decision, the appellant has lodged this appeal vide a Memorandum of Appeal dated 27/1/2022. The appeal is based on 4 grounds of appeal which can be summarized into two as follows: - 
That the Tribunal erred in holding that the objection decision was issued prematurely without consideration of available information.
That the Tribunal erred in in finding that due process was not followed prior to the objection and setting aside the appellant’s assessment.",court,54.26%,model
"In opposition to the appeal, the respondent filed a statement of facts dated 23/2/2023. He contended that he was a landlord whose sole income emanated from his two properties situate in Nakuru County. That vide a letter dated 3/3/2015, he wrote to the appellant requesting to file his returns on annual basis since he had taken out a loan at Equity bank for Kshs 7,305,695/- with a repayment of Kshs. 241,665/- against a monthly income of Kshs 184,430/-.
That the appellant did not respond to his letter and the respondent therefore assumed that his request had been accepted and continued to submit annual returns. That he filed his annual returns on 25/03/2017 for the year 2016 and on 24/05/2018 for the year 2017 and paid a total of Kshs. 100.509/-. Vide a letter dated 3/3/2015, he wrote to the appellant to avoid paying rental income out of his capital investment.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions which have been considered. The appellant submitted that the respondent failed to declare and charge tax on the annual rental income earned in 2016. That the respondent’s notice of objection was not supported by documents hence failed to discharge the burden of proof to show that the assessment was incorrect.
On whether due process was followed prior to issuance of the objection decision, the appellant submitted that the respondent was given sufficient time to support his objection. It was further submitted that the Tribunal’s decision on this issue was outside the parties’ pleadings since the same had not been raised by the appellant. That section3 and 6 of the Income Tax Act was clear on the fact that all the profits or gains made by the respondent from rent was chargeable to income tax.
The respondent submitted that the appeal was filed outside the 30 days prescribed by law without leave and ought to be struck off. According to the respondent, the appellant’s assessment was based on the assumption that, the respondent owned 34 rental houses and failed to conduct any investigations on the same.",court,54.04%,model
"Counsel submitted that the respondent discharged his burden of proof by providing the information required in line with section 56(1) of the Tax Procedures Act and section 30 of the Tax Appeals Tribunal Act. That the appellant had visited the respondent’s premises and established that some houses with meters remained unoccupied. That the application to file annual returns was not rejected by the appellant.
I have considered the record. The main issue for determination is whether the objection decision was issued prematurely without consideration of the available information.
The appellant’s assessment was based on the fact that, he had conducted an investigation on the respondent and discovered that the latter had to his name 34 KPLC meters. He therefore concluded that the respondent had 34 rentals houses. The assessment was confirmed because the respondent failed to provide relevant documentation to support the objection.
On his part, the respondent contended that the assessment for the years 2016 and 2017 was done using the old format and the same had been communicated to the appellant. That at the objection stage, he had submitted the documents as required under section 59 of the Tax Procedures Act.
Section 24 of the Tax Procedures Act (“the TPA”) provides: -
“Submission of tax returns 
(1)■A person required to submit a tax return under a tax law shall submit the return in the approved form and in the manner prescribed by the Commissioner. 
(2)■The Commissioner shall not be bound by a tax return or information provided by, or on behalf of, a taxpayer and the Commissioner may assess a taxpayer's tax liability using any information available to the Commissioner.”
Based on section 24 of the TPA, the Commissioner has the authority to issue an assessment based on any available information. From the record, there is no evidence of the initial assessment that demanded tax of Kshs. 803,311/- from the respondent. While it is evident that the assessment was based on the information received on the KPLC meters, it is not clear how that figure was arrived at. 
Section 56 of the TPA places the burden of proof in tax cases on the tax payer. The above section is reinforced by section 30 of the Tax Appeals Tribunal Act.",court,53.36%,model
"In the present case, it is evident that in the notice of objection, the tax payer stated that he had paid his taxes and availed the letter dated 3/3/2015 where he had previously informed the appellant of his intention to pay taxes using the previous format. 
No evidence was availed by the appellant requesting for additional information. The record shows that the taxpayer paid taxes for the disputed years and still filed returns for the said years although not in the correct format. In that regard, the burden shifted to the appellant to demonstrate that the material presented to him by the respondent was either wrong or insufficient. Since no further information or document was requested at this stage, the burden rested on the Commissioner to prove the assessment. The pendulum of the burden of proof never swung back to the respondent at all.
Section 51(3) of the TPA gives the format for the notice for objection as follows: -
“(3)■A notice of objection shall be treated as validly lodged by a taxpayer under subsection (2) if—
a)■the notice of objection states precisely the grounds of objection, the amendments required to be made to correct the decision, and the reasons for the amendments;
b)■in relation to an objection to an assessment, the taxpayer has paid the entire amount of tax due under the assessment that is not in dispute or has applied for an extension of time to pay the tax not in dispute under section 33(1); and
c)■ all the relevant documents relating to the objection have been submitted.”
From the forgoing, a notice of objection can only be said to be valid when all the relevant documents have been submitted. Sub section 4 places an obligation on the Commissioner to inform the tax payer in writing that a notice of objection does not meet the required standards.
In the present case, this is not a case of a taxpayer who has refused to pay taxes. It is a case of a willing tax payer who was mistreated by the tax authority. He had the willingness to comply with the law and wrote to the appellant seeking clarification or direction which was never provided.  The appellant was under an obligation to respond to the respondent’s inquiry and advise him whether or not he had approved the letter dated 3/3/2015. This would have informed the respondent the manner in which to pay taxes. In this case, silence should be taken to have been consent.",court,53.53%,model
"Based on the foregoing, I find no error on the Tribunals holding that the objection decision was premature. 
Accordingly, the Court finds the appeal to be without merit and the same is dismissed with costs.
It is so decreed.

The deceased, Francis Karisho Nguti, died on 18/04/2012 at the age of 50 years. 3 months later on 24/07/2012, the Petitioners, describing themselves as widow and daughter, respectively, filed a Petition seeking Letters of Administration intestate over the estate. However on 28/10/2016, the 1st Objector, claiming to be the rightful widow, filed a Cross-Petition and also an Answer opposing the Petitioner’s Application. To my knowledge and from my perusal of the record, no Grant has therefore been issued by the Court to date.
The matter has since then experienced a long and protracted litigation with a massive number of interlocutory Applications and counter-Applications filed for and against, particularly by the 1st Objector. As a result, no meaningful progress has been made in the matter ever since.
Now before the Court is the 1st Objector’s Application brought by way of the Notice of Motion dated 6/7/2022 seeking the following orders:
That the Applicant herein, Cecilia Nyakarura, be appointed as the administrator of the estate of the deceased.

Regarding the 2nd Petitioner, it is not clear whether she is being represented by the same Advocates representing the 1st Petitioner, Mathai Maina & Co. This is because there is no reference to her whatsoever in the pleadings filed by the law firm.

"1st Objector’s Submissions
Counsel for the 1st Objector submitted that the Petitioners instituted these Succession Cause without the knowledge of the Objectors, the 1st Petitioner is claiming to be the 2nd widow of the deceased and the 2nd Petitioner alleges to be a dependent even though she is not a child of the deceased, the 1st Objector filed cross-Petition for letters of Administration in this matter on 26/10/2016 as the sole widow, prior to the institution of these proceedings the 1st Petitioner had attempted to stop the burial of the deceased on grounds that she had not been recognized, the same culminated in the institution of Eldoret CMCC No. 323 of 2012 wherein the Court ordered the 1st Petitioner’s alleged children with the deceased to undergo DNA tests, the 1st Petitioner and her alleged children however have been unwilling to comply with the orders and are yet to comply more than 10 years later,  according to the Chief’s letter dated 6/06/2022 the beneficiaries of the deceased are as listed in the 1st Objector’s Application, the Petitioners are not beneficiaries of the estate, the 1st Petitioner’s allegations that she was a wife of the deceased is highly contested, unless and until a determination is made by the Court on the 1st Petitioners alleged marriage and legitimacy, her attempts to be appointed as a co-administrator is premature and untenable and that the 1st Objector is the only spouse of the deceased as demonstrated by the proof of payment of dowry made on 2/7/1995, the Objector therefore ranks higher pursuant to Section 66 of the Law of Succession Act and Rule 7 of the Probate & Administration Rules than her children with the deceased including the 2nd Objector who is a son to the deceased.",court,57.46%,model
"Counsel submitted further that the allegations by the 1st Petitioner that she raised and paid school fees for the 1st Petitioner’s children is misleading, by the Ruling dated 7/09/2014 the ex parte orders given in Children Case No. 399 of 2013 were set aside on grounds that the same were obtained through concealment of material facts and misrepresentation, the Petitioner has concocted undated photographs alleging that the photographs belong to the Objector’s children with the motive of misleading the Court, in any event, the 1st Petitioner does not qualify to be an Administrator since she has been intermeddling and wasting the deceased’s estate in contravention of Section 45 of the Law of Succession Act and has even been charged over the same in Eldoret Criminal Case No. 995 of 2017, she has even been restrained from intermeddling with the deceased’s share in Eldoret Succession Cause No. 36 of 2002 vide orders made on 4/06/2014 and that the estate shall be at great risk of anarchy should the 1st Petitioner be appointed an Administrator.

1st Petitioner’s Submissions",court,56.96%,model
"1st Petitioner’s Submissions
On whether the 1st Petitioner was a “spouse”, Counsel cited Section 2 of the Marriage Act 2014 and submitted that the 1st Petitioner was a spouse to the deceased because she cohabited with the deceased as husband and wife from the year 2000 and that she bore two children with the deceased, Newton Nguti Karisho and Lizzie Wamere Karisho, the deceased also accepted the 2nd Petitioner as his child, the 1st Petitioner thus qualifies to be appointed as one of the administrators because she is a surviving spouse, the 1st Petitioner took part in the burial of the deceased after obtaining a Court order since the 1st Objector had wanted to stop her from participating in the burial, the 1st Petitioner was recognized as one of the wives, the birth certificates also confirm that the children of the 1st Petitioner took the surname of the deceased. Counsel cited the case of Joseph Gitau Githongo v Victoria Mwihaki [2014] eKLR, Phylis Njoki Karanja & 2 Others v Rosemary Mueni Karanja & Another, Nrb CA Civil Appeal No. 313 of 2001 [2009] eKLR and Hortensiah Wanjiku Yawe v Public Trustee CA Civil Appeal No. 13 of 1976 (UR).
On whether the 1st Objector should be appointed as the sole administrator of the estate, Counsel submitted that the law is clear on who can be appointed as administrators, he cited Section 56(1)(a) and (b) of the Law of Succession Act and submitted that the number of Administrators is capped to a maximum of 4, the 1st Petitioner was a wife of the deceased and hence ought to be involved in the affairs of the estate, the 1st Objector is selfish and greedy and does not want her co-wife to be involved in the affairs of the estate. On the allegations of intermeddling, Counsel submitted that the 1st Objector has not tabled any evidence to support the allegations or that the 1st Petitioner was found guilty or convicted.",court,55.06%,model
"Regarding preference in appointment of Administrators, Counsel submitted that the 1st Petitioner ought to be given preference, she has equal status as the 1st Objector since she was married to the deceased. He cited Section 66 of the Law of Succession Act.
Analysis and Determination
After careful analysis, I find that the issue that arises for determination to be the following:
“Between the 1st Objector and the 1st Petitioner, who should be appointed as the Administrator of the estate of the deceased?”.
The matter of appointment of Administrators is one in which the final discretion lies with the Court. However, Section 66 of the Law of Succession Act gives guidelines on the order of priority to be adopted. It provides as follows: 
“When a deceased has died intestate, the court shall, save as otherwise expressly provided, have a final discretion as to the person or persons to whom a grant of letters of administration shall, in the best interests of all concerned, be made, but shall, without prejudice to that discretion, accept as a general guide the following order of preference-
(a)surviving spouse or spouses, with or without association of other beneficiaries;
(b)other beneficiaries entitled on intestacy, with priority according to their respective beneficial interests as provided by part v;
(c)the public trustee; and
(d)creditors”
From the evidence that has been tendered, the 1st Objector’s status as a widow and the status of her children are not contested by the 1st Petitioner. The 1st Objector’s claim that she has been married to the deceased since the year 1995 under Kikuyu customary law and that together they got 3 children has also not been disputed. She has exhibited a copy of a letter from the Chief listing her as the only wife and confirming her 4 children. By virtue of Section 66 above, her entitlement as an Administrator is therefore clear and well grounded.",court,56.42%,model
"On her part, the 1st Petitioner claims that she was a second wife to the deceased having begun cohabiting with the deceased from the year 2000. She states that she already had one child before she met the deceased and whom the deceased took in as his own. She further claims that she subsequently got two children with the deceased in the year 2002 and 2010, respectively. Although she has exhibited copies of Birth Certificates for the 3 children and which bear the name of the deceased as the father, all these contentions are denied by the Objectors. The result is therefore that the Petitioner’s claims are yet to be proved at this stage. The legitimacy of her alleged marriage to the deceased and the question whether her children have linkage to the deceased are matters that are still under contention awaiting proof. 
The 1st Objector has also made the allegation that prior to the institution of this Cause, the 1st Petitioner had attempted to stop the burial of the deceased on grounds that she had not been recognized, that the 1st Petitioner then instituted Eldoret CMCC No. 323 of 2012, that in that suit the Court ordered that the 1st Petitioner’s children do undergo DNA tests to authenticate their alleged paternity by the deceased. According to the 1st Objector, the order, made 10 years ago, has not been complied with by the 1st Petitioner and her children. A copy of the Order was exhibited. It is not lost on me that the 1st Petitioner has maintained a loud and studious silence over this allegation and has not controverted it.
 
The fact that the Petitioners are yet to comply with the order issued in Eldoret CMCC No. 323 of 2013 on DNA tests and the fact that, at this stage, the Petitioners are also yet to prove their claims over the estate were also well captured in paragraphs 22 and 23 of the said Ruling delivered on 22/01/2021 by H. Omondi J (as she then was), in Eldoret High Court Succession Cause No. 36 of 2002. That Cause deals with the estate of the deceased’s father.",court,57.74%,model
"Be that as it may, the parties have to appreciate that, at this stage, the Court is only dealing with the sole issue of appointment of an Administrator to the estate. It is therefore premature for the Court to address or purport to determine issues on whether the 1st Petitioner was a “wife” to the deceased and whether her children are beneficiaries of the estate. These are issues that shall be canvassed and determined during the trial of this Cause.
I however have to mention that the Petitioners do not come out as candid litigants. I say so because I have perused the Petition for Letters of Administration filed by the Petitioners and observe that in the letter from the Chief, Pioneer location, Eldoret, dated 15/06/2012 that they presented, the Petitioners did not at all make any mention whatsoever of the 1st Objector as a wife or survivor of the deceased and also out of the 1st Objectors four children, the Petitioners only mentioned two and left out the other two. Since clearly the Petitioners were always aware of the existence of the 1st Objector as a wife to the deceased and also her children, and therefore as genuine survivors of the deceased, in the absence of any explanation, I find this conduct by the Petitioners to have been deliberate suppression of material facts and in extension, done in bad faith and calculated to mislead the Court. 
Having analyzed the facts and since the estate cannot be left unadministered pending distribution, the question now is who between the 1st Objector and the 1st Petitioner should be appointed to be the Administrator.
In answering the said question, I have considered that both the 1st Petitioner and the 1st Objector are presently in occupation of respective portions of the estate properties. In the circumstances, one may be inclined to appoint the two as joint Administrators pending distribution. However, considering the level of “bad blood” and hostility that is apparent between the two, appointing them as joint Administrators is likely to only escalate the already heightened acrimony between them and as a result, paralyze operations of the estate.",court,55.44%,model
"In the circumstances, considering that the status of the 1st Objector as a widow is not contested and weighing it against the Petitioners’ conduct of appearing to avoid, defy or ignore the Court order given on 3/05/2012 in Eldoret Chief Magistrates Court Civil Suit No. 323 of 2012 on the taking of samples to conduct DNA tests on her children and also factoring the Petitioners’ inexplicable act of omitting to disclose the 1st Objector and her children as survivors of the deceased, I find that the balance of convenience clearly tilts towards appointing the 1st Objector as the sole Administrator for now.
I must also remind the parties that intermeddling of whatever kind is forbidden under Section 45 of the Law of Succession Act. The parties and all other interested stakeholders are therefore not expected to misuse, waste, place out of reach or part with any portion of the estate in any manner whatsoever until such time that the Grant shall be confirmed by the Court and assets distributed accordingly. They should always be aware that they all are under a statutory obligation to ensure that the estate remains well preserved.
Final Orders 
For the foregoing reasons, I allow the 1st Objector’s Notice of Motion of Motion dated 6/07/2022 in the following terms:
The 1st Objector - Cecilia Nyakarura Gicheru – is hereby appointed the sole Administrator of the estate of the late Francis Karisho Nguti.
A Grant shall now be issued to the 1st Objector, the said Cecilia Nyakarura Gicheru.
This matter shall then be fixed for hearing for purposes of the Petitioners proving their claims against, or their entitlements to the estate herein.
I note that the Court had previously, pending distribution of the estate, issued various orders, including orders restraining intermeddling with the estate and also relating to preservation, occupation, utilization and use of respective estate properties, and also including injunctions in some cases. For avoidance of doubt, such orders shall not be affected by the present orders now given hereinabove and shall continue being in force until further directions by the Court.
Costs shall be in the Cause.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF KENYA AT ELDORET
CIVIL CASE NO. 3 OF 2022
(FORMERLY KITALE ELC CASE NO. 5 OF 2016
AMIT AGGARWAL (suing as administrator of the 
estate of GURCHARAN DASS AGGARWAL)…………………………………PLAINTIFF
VERSUS
NATIONAL BANK OF KENYA LIMITED…………………………………..DEFENDANT
RULING
By the Plaint filed on 14/12/2015, the Plaintiff, suing as the Administrator of the said deceased, filed this suit. The Plaintiff sought, inter alia, Judgment barring the Defendant, a bank, from exercising its statutory power of sale over various properties which had secured financial facilities advanced to the deceased by the Defendant. The Court granted an interlocutory injunction pending determination of the suit. 
From the record, I gather that the suit was initially filed before this Court in 2015, then sometime in 2016 was transferred to the Environment & Land Court at Kitale before being re-transferred in 2022 back to this Court at Eldoret. 
In the course of the matter, the Plaintiff filed the Application dated 21/11/2016 seeking leave to deposit the sum of Kshs 7,658,191.40 as security, in exchange for release of the titles held by the Defendant, pending determination of the suit. The said sum was the amount alleged by the Defendant to be owing, as at that time, from the deceased. The parties then recorded a consent on terms that, pending determination of the Application, the Plaintiff would deposit in an interest earning account in the joint names of the Advocates for the parties, a sum of Kshs 9,000,000/- to be held as security pending agreement by the parties and/or upon such orders as shall be made by the Court. The account was to be opened at the Defendant bank. Upon deposit of the amount as aforesaid, the Defendant would, not later than 3 days, release to the Plaintiff the Certificate of Lease for the property Eldoret Municipality/Block 6/6 among those held by the Defendant. Also to be released was discharge of Charge for the same one property.",court,54.96%,model
"Now before the Court is the Plaintiff’s Application (Notice of Motion) dated 23/08/2022 seeking orders as follows:
Spent.
THAT the Honourable Court be pleased to issue an order to review, vary and/or set aside the Consent Order dated 21st December, 2016 and adopted by the Court on 9th February 2017 to the effect that; 
The Plaintiff/Applicant to deposit in an interest earning account in the joint names of the advocates for the parties that is M/s. Nyairo and Company, Advocates and M/s. Gumbo & Associates, Advocates the sum of Kenya Shillings Nine Million (KShs.9,000,000/=) to be held pending agreement by the parties and/or upon such orders as shall be made by the Court. The said account to be opened at National Bank of Kenya Limited, Eldoret Branch. 
Upon deposit of the amount referred to in paragraph (a) above the Defendant/Respondent forthwith and in any event not later than three (3) days to release to the Plaintiff/Applicant's advocate the following documents; 
 Certificate of Lease over title number Eldoret Municipality/Block 6/6.
 Duly executed discharge of charge in respect of title Eldoret Municipality/Block

Nyairo and Company, Advocates and M/s. Gumbo and Associates, Advocates be transferred to an independent joint interest earning account to be opened in the joint names of the advocates for the parties herein stated above.
The Defendant/Respondent and/or its Directors be compelled to provide statements of account for the period between 21st December, 2016 to date. 
THAT the Court be pleased to order interest on the said sum of Kenya Shillings nine million (Kshs. 9,000,000/=) for the period between 21st December, 2016 to date.",court,53.66%,model
"THAT upon opening and transferring the said funds into an independent joint interest earning account, there be an order directing the Defendant/Respondent to provide quarterly statements of account to the Plaintiff/Applicant not later than the 5th day of the next quarter.
THAT there be an order compelling the Defendant/Respondent to release to the Plaintiff Applicant's Advocate the original lease certificate for Eldoret Municipality/Block 6/6 and a duly executed discharge of charge in respect of the said in line with the Court order aforesaid.
 
THAT in default of item 7 above, warrants of arrest do issue against the Directors and the Managers of the Defendants/Respondents bank automatically for disobeying Court orders.
THAT costs for the Application be provided for.
The Application is filed through Messrs Nyairo & Co.

It is premised on the grounds set out thereon and the contents of the Supporting Affidavit sworn by the Plaintiff, Amit Aggarwal.",court,55.86%,model
"In the Affidavit, the Plaintiff deponed that upon the said consent order being adopted as an order of the Court, he paid the sum of Kshs 9,000,000/- to the Defendant which was to be deposited in a joint interest earning account in the names of the parties’ Advocates herein, upon receiving the funds, in blatant disregard to the Court order, the Defendant deposited or placed the same in a non-interest earning account, the Defendant has kept him in the dark as to the account and its performance and has declined or failed to provide him with statements of account to date, the move by the Defendant to deposit the amount in a non-interest earning account is against the Court order and only intended to benefit the Defendant, Court orders are not for decorative purposes but must be specifically adhered to, despite compliance on the Plaintiff’s part, the Defendant has also failed to deliver the Certificate of Lease and discharge of Charge for the said property. He then reiterated the prayers made in the Application and added that it is now over 5 years since the amount was placed in a non-interest earning account thus causing him tremendous loss and that the Defendant does not stand to suffer any loss if the prayers are granted.
Defendant’s Response",court,53.41%,model
"Defendant’s Response
The Defendant opposed the Application vide the Replying Affidavit sworn by one Margaret Jepkemo and filed on 31/10/2022 through Messrs G&A Advocates LLP. She described herself as the Respondent’s Eldoret Branch Manager and deponed that in compliance with the consent Court order and after the Advocates had executed the account opening Forms, a Business Banking Account was consequently operationalized and assigned a number in the joint names of the Advocates on record, on 19/01/2017 the Plaintiff’s Advocates deposited the Kshs. 9,000,000/- into the account, given the nature of the account sought being an interest earning account, a Call Deposit Account was opened alongside the business Banking Account, a Call Deposit Account acts as an ancillary to the main account for the purposes of earning interest, on 14/09/2017 the Kshs 9,000,000/- was deposited into the Call Deposit Account to enable the account attract interest as ordered by the Court, as at the date of swearing the Affidavit, the accrued interest stood at Kshs. 2,348,876.71, the averments that there is non-compliance with the Court order is far-fetched and un-informed, as opposed to filing the instant Application, the Applicant’s Counsel would have exercised some diligence by visiting the Defendant and obtained proper information regarding the status of the account.
She deponed further that the Respondent, through its Advocates, released the Certificate of Lease and duly executed the discharge to the Plaintiff’s Advocates vide letters which were duly received and acknowledged. In conclusion, he deponed that from the foregoing, it is clear that the Defendant has fully complied with the terms of the Court order.
Plaintiff’s Supplementary Affidavit",court,52.79%,model
"Plaintiff’s Supplementary Affidavit
In a rejoinder, the Applicant filed a Supplementary Affidavit on 2/11/2022. He deponed that the Defendant’s Replying Affidavit is a confirmation that the Defendant did not comply with the terms of the consent because the funds were to be deposited in a joint interest earning account in the names of both Advocates, from the bank statement exhibited by the Defendant, it is clear that no interest has accrued as was contemplated by the parties in the consent, the call deposit account, if indeed it is in existence, is not an account opened in the names of both Advocates, there is no evidence that either he or his Advocates were notified of the opening of a Call Deposit Account or signed the account opening forms for the same, this is evidenced by the statement of account which reveals that only the Defendant’s Advocates are the Account holders, there is no telling whether the said account has any relation with the account opened by both Advocates and the consent executed by the parties, in any event, from the statement exhibited, it is evident that the Call Deposit Account has also not accrued interest, the fact that the Defendant moved the Kshs 9,000,000/- to a different account which the Plaintiff has no control over and without his consent is reason enough to grant the orders sought, he has no control of how the purported Call Deposit Account is operated, the statement also reveals that the said account was opened on 14/09/2017 yet there is no account of the interest that accrued from the date the Plaintiff deposited the Kshs. 9,000,000/- on 19/01/2017 to September 2017 when the purported Call Deposit Account was opened.
Hearing of the Application 
With concurrence of the parties, I directed that they file written Submissions. Pursuant thereto, the Plaintiff filed Submissions on 26/10/2022 while the Defendant filed on 30/01/2022.
Plaintiff’s Submissions",court,53.06%,model
"Plaintiff’s Submissions
Counsel for Applicant submitted that upon the consent order being adopted, the Plaintiff released the Kshs. 9,000,000/- to the Respondent which amount was to be deposited in a joint interest earning account in the names of the parties’ Advocates, upon receiving the amount, and in blatant disregard to the Court order, the Defendant deposited the amount in a non interest earning account no. 01282130554700, it is the Plaintiff’s fear that the Defendant may have appropriated the funds given that the Defendant has kept the Plaintiff in the dark, further, the Defendant has also failed to deliver to the Plaintiff the Certificate of Lease over title no. Eldoret Municipality/Block 6/6 and the duly executed discharge of Charge over the same property in breach of the consent order, Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules empowers the Court to grant an order for Review where sufficient grounds are demonstrated, the Defendant’s action to continue retaining funds million without any interest accruing is to the detriment of the Plaintiff and the beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased, whereas the monies have been held at the Defendant’s bank since 2016 and the Defendant can trade in it for commercial gain, the Plaintiff has not benefited from the same as he has not only been denied use of the funds but also denied the interest which would have automatically accrued if the Defendant had complied with the terms of the consent order, it is because of the Defendant’s action to defraud the Plaintiff of the interest on the sum is sufficient reason to warrant this Court’s intervention to review the consent order and allow the prayer to have the money deposited in account no. 01282130554700 transferred in an independent interest earning account, to order the Defendant to provide the statement of account for the joint account between 21/12/2016 to date and order the Defendant to account for the interest that ought to have accrued thereon since 2016 on the Kshs 9,000,000/-. She cited the case of Alberto Carnavale v Giovanni Gremmo [2005] eKLR.
Counsel submitted further that the Defendant’s failure to release the title and discharge of Charge for the property Eldoret Municipality/Block 6/6 which would have enabled the estate of the deceased to put to good use the said property is sufficient reason to grant the orders.
Defendant’s Submissions",court,53.66%,model
"Defendant’s Submissions
Counsel for Applicant submitted that upon receipt of the Kshs 9,000,000/- from the Plaintiff, the Defendant opened a Business Banking Account No. 01282130554700 in the joint names of the Advocates on record, since the Court directed that the sums ought to incur interest, an ancillary account referred to as Call Deposit Account No. 01400130554700 was opened for the sole purposes of earning interest, as at 25/10/2022, the interest stood at Kshs 2,348,867.71, in further compliance with the consent order, the Defendant also forwarded the duly executed discharge of Charge for the property Eldoret Municipality Block 6/6 to the Plaintiff, seemingly unaware of the above transactions, rather than carrying out due diligence with the Defendant, the Plaintiff filed the present Application.
According to Counsel, the Plaintiff has not laid a foundation with regards to discovery of new and important evidence, or shown any mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or any sufficient reason as to why the order ought to be reviewed. He cited the case of Alpha Fine Foods Limited v Horeca Kenya Limited & 4 Others [2021] eKLR. He then submitted that the Plaintiff has also not specified the ground upon which he is seeking review and cited the cases of Wilfred Murungi Mboroki & 16 Others v Mutua Mugambi M’Rewa & 2 Others [2002] eKLR which, he submitted, quoted the case of Otieno, Ragot & Company Advocates vs National Bank of Kenya Limited [2020] eKLR.
Counsel submitted further that in reality the Plaintiff seeks variation of the Court order, which cannot be said to be review, he attempts to re-write the terms of the order rather than correct an error apparent. He cited the case of Hosea Nyandika Mosagwe & 2 Others v County Government of Nyamira [2002] eKLR.
He contended further that at no point has the Applicant ever sought for the account statement, nothing would have been easier for the Plaintiff than walking to the bank and requesting for one.",court,53.28%,model
"Counsel concluded by maintaining that the order was fully complied with and as such all the prayers sought are moot, if at all the Plaintiff is raising valid and legitimate concerns, then he would have taken the more drastic route of citing the Defendant’s officers for contempt. 
Analysis & Determination
The issue for determination in this matter is “whether the Court should review, vary or set aside the consent order dated 21/12/2016 and also grant the consequential orders prayed for”.
It is trite law that any party seeking review of Court orders is bound by the provisions of Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules. In respect thereto, Order 45 provides as follows:
1. (1) Any person considering himself aggrieved—
(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or
(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.
In Paul Mwaniki vs. National Hospital Insurance Fund Board of Management [2020] eKLR, it was said:
“… a review may be granted whenever the Court considers that it is necessary to correct an apparent error or omission on the part of the Court. The error or omission must be self-evident and should not require an elaborate argument to be established. It will not be a sufficient ground for review that another Judge could have taken a different view of the matter. Nor can it be a ground for review that the Court proceeded on an incorrect exposition of the law and reached an erroneous conclusion of law. Misconstruing a statute or other provision of law cannot be a ground for review.”",court,57.56%,model
"It is therefore clear that Order 45 provides for three circumstances under which an order for review can be made. The first one is where there has been discovery of new and important matter or evidence. The second is where there has been a mistake or error apparent on the face of the record. The third ground is “for any other sufficient reason”. Although the Application does not disclose the ground under which it has been brought, in the Submissions filed on his behalf, reference has been made to the ground of “for any other sufficient reason” ground.
Further, noting that the order in question was made pursuant to a consent letter signed by the parties, it is imperative to note the circumstances within which a consent order can be reviewed, varied or set aside. On this point, the Court of Appeal, in the case of Brooke Bond Liebig v Mallya 1975 E.A 266 held as follows:
“A consent judgment may only be set aside for fraud collusion, or for any reason which would enable the Court to set aside an agreement.”
Again, the Court of Appeal in the case of Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. v. Specialized Engineering Co. Ltd (1982) KLR P.485 held that;
A consent order entered into by counsel is binding on all parties to the proceedings and cannot be set aside or varied unless it is proved that it was obtained by fraud or by an agreement contrary to the policy of the Court or where the consent was given without sufficient material facts or in misapprehension or ignorance of such facts in general for a reason which would enable the Court set aside an agreement.
Finally, Hancox JA (as he then was), in the case of Flora Wasike v. Destimo Wamboko (1982 -1988)1 KAR 625 stated as follows:
“It is now settled law that a consent judgement or order has contractual effect and can only be set aside on grounds which would justify setting a contract aside, or if certain conditions remain to be fulfilled, which are not carried out ….. “",court,56.36%,model
"From my analysis of the facts set out in the Application, the Plaintiff’s grievance is in regard to the manner in which the Defendant has chosen to implement the consent order or the mode of compliance adopted, and not the contents thereof. Applying the above principles to the matter at hand, I find that the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any basis for review, variation or setting aside of the consent order. Although the Plaintiff has termed the Defendant’s alleged failure to comply with the consent order as an act of “fraud”, I do not find any circumstances giving rise to an inference of “fraud” on the part of the Defendant. I therefore find that none of the recognized grounds for review of a consent order has been demonstrated. Accordingly, I decline the invitation to review, vary or set aside the consent order dated 21/12/2016.
This however is not the end of the matter. The Plaintiff seeks orders to compel the Defendant to comply with the terms of the consent order. On its part, the Defendant contends that it has fully complied with the order as directed. 
To demonstrate that it has so complied, the Defendant exhibited a copy of the account opening Application Form signed by Advocates for both the respective parties in respect to account No. 01282130554700 opened at the Defendant bank. Also exhibited is a copy of a statement of account confirming the deposit of the said amount of Kshs. 9,000,000/- on 19/01/2017 into the account. The same statement then indicates that subsequently on 14/09/2017, about 8 months later, a Call Deposit transfer of the whole amount was made. The account therefore reflected a nil balance. There is however no evidence supplied to indicate under whose instructions the transfer was made. There is also no evidence to confirm that the name of the Plaintiff’s Advocates appears in the account as joint or co-account holders. There is also no evidence to demonstrate that the Defendant was consulted or agreed or was even informed of this call deposit transfer.",court,54.15%,model
"As regards the Call Deposit Account itself, the Defendant has exhibited a statement bearing the account number 01400130554700 (a different number) indicating that indeed the said Kshs 9,000,000/- was transferred thereto. However, the statement only bears the name of the Defendant’s Advocates with no reference whatsoever to the Plaintiff’s Advocates as joint holders. The Defendant has then exhibited what appears to an extract of a further statement indicating that, as at October 2022, the Call Deposit Account had accrued interest at an amount of Kshs 2,348,876.71/-.
From the foregoing, my view is that the money is in safe custody and available when required. I do not think that the Defendant’s fears are merited. From my understanding, placing funds in a Call Deposit for a specified period of time is a normal practice and is mostly adopted to attract higher interest on dormant funds lying in a bank account. Needless to state however, it is the Account holder, the owner of the funds, not the bank, who makes a request for such transfer and to whom, in any event, all the interest accrued belongs to, not the bank.
It is therefore very well possible, as I believe, that the transfer of the funds to the Call Deposit Account was done in utmost good faith and meant, in the long run, to benefit and be advantageous to both parties. As aforesaid, perhaps it would even fetch a higher interest and perhaps serve as a more convenient tool to the bank in handling the money. However, being a consent order, the same must be implemented strictly as per its terms. It does not matter how well-intentioned the Defendant could have been when it transferred the funds to the Call Deposit Account. Save with the concurrence of the Plaintiff, the Defendant had no right to unilaterally, and without consultation, transfer the funds to any different Account, whether ancillary, associated, connected or related to the main account as argued by the Defendant.",court,52.48%,model
"I also agree with the Plaintiff’s observation that the Call Deposit Account statement reveals that the same was opened on 14/09/2017, about 8 months after the amount of Kshs 9,000,000/- was deposited by the Plaintiff on 19/01/2017 yet there is no account or mention of any interest that accrued for that 8 months period as was required under the terms of the consent order. 
Further, without evidence that the name of the Plaintiff’s Advocates appears in the Call Deposit Account as a co-Account holder and without any evidence that the Call Deposit Account is even associated, ancillary, connected or related to the main account as alleged, the Plaintiff is left with no avenue of assuring himself that his interest over the account is secured. I therefore find that the Defendant’s act of transferring the funds to the Call Deposit Account was irregular, not necessarily in breach of the order, but clearly irregular.
Regarding release of the Certificate of Lease for the property Eldoret Municipality/Block 6/6 and the duly executed discharge of Charge for the same property, the Defendant has alleged that the same were released to the Plaintiff in January 2017. The Defendant has then exhibited a copy of the letter dated 20/01/2017 which however only indicates release of the discharge of Charge. Although in the Replying Affidavit the Defendant has referred to a second letter dated 11/01/2017, no such letter appears among the exhibits as indicated. I however note that the Plaintiff did not in his Supplementary Affidavit, comment on this allegation of release of the said documents. The Court is therefore not in a position to ascertain whether indeed the said documents were released in full.
Final Orders
In the premises, the Plaintiff’s Application dated 23/08/2022 only partially succeeds in the following terms:",court,54.38%,model
"The Defendant shall, within seven (7) days from the date hereof, with no deduction or any kind of penalty levied against the account, re-transfer all the funds, monies or amounts placed in the Call Deposit Account number 01400130554700 or any other Call Deposit Account, together with all interest accrued thereon from the date that the account was opened, back into the main Account number 01282130554700 held at the Defendant bank and ensure that, at all times, the name of the Plaintiff’s Advocates, namely, Nyairo & Co. Advocates appears and/or is included as a joint or co-holder of the account, together with the Defendant’s Advocates and also ensure that the account is and remains, at all times, interest earning.
For avoidance of doubt, interest on the amount of Kshs 9,000,000/- paid or deposited by the Plaintiff into the account number 01282130554700 shall or is required to have accrued as from 19/01/2017, the date when the amount was paid or deposited by the Plaintiff.
If by its nature, the main account number 01282130554700 is not capable of attracting interest, then the Defendant must, with the approval and/or concurrence of the Plaintiff, forthwith open a new interest earning bank account in the joint names of the Advocates on record for the respective parties and deposit all the funds, including interest accrued to date, into the new account. In whatever case, the Defendant must still account for and remit the interest that was required to have accrued as from 19/01/2017, the date when the amount of Kshs 9,000,000/- was paid or deposited by the Plaintiff.
The Defendant shall, within fourteen (14) days from the date hereof, and at no cost to the Plaintiff, supply to the Plaintiff, up to date statement or statements of account showing the manner in which the amount of Kshs 9,000,000/- deposited and/or paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant pursuant to the said consent order dated 21/12/2016 has been handled or applied, as from the date when the amount was paid and/or deposited, to the present date, including interest accrued thereon.",court,51.32%,model
"Thereafter, the Defendant shall continue to provide to the Plaintiff regular quarterly statements of account for each year as from the date hereof, not later than on the 5th day of the next quarter of each year. 
Regarding release by the Defendant of the Certificate of Lease for the property Eldoret Municipality/Block 6/6 and the duly executed discharge of Charge for the same property to the Plaintiff, in the event that the same have not yet been so released as directed in the consent order dated 21/12/2016, then the Defendant shall forthwith, and in any event not later than seven (7) days from the date hereof release the same to the Plaintiff.
Costs of the Application is awarded to the Plaintiff.
The parties shall now take steps to ensure expeditious prosecution of this suit.

The said appeal has been filed over Eighteen (18) months out of time.
The appellant did not seek leave to file the appeal out of time.

"Time for filing appeals from subordinate courts 
Every appeal from a subordinate court to the High Court shall be filed within a period of thirty days from the date of the decree or order appealed against, excluding from such period any time which the lower court may certify as having been requisite for the preparation and delivery to the appellant of a copy of the decree or order: 
Provided that an appeal may be admitted out of time if the appellant satisfies the court that he had good and sufficient cause for not filing the appeal in time.
The 3rd respondent argued that Appellant’s right of appeal only lies where the law specifically provides for such right to accrue and where no such right is automatic. The right of appeal is conferred by statute and cannot be inferred. Like any party seeking to appeal the decision of the Co-operatives Tribunal, the Appellant should have first obtained leave of court to extend time.  
That further an issue of time limitation goes to the jurisdiction of the Court. This Court is clothed with Appellate jurisdiction solely under the provisions of Section 81 of Cap 490 which the Appellant has violated. Therefore, this court does not have sufficient jurisdiction to entertain the various grounds of Appeal filed in respect of the ruling delivered on 6/6/2017.
The appellants on the other hand submitted that the application herein should be dismissed for being an abuse of court process because the application is sworn by a stranger. Mr. Ndegwa is neither the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Treasurer, Secretary or a Board of Director of the committee. The 2nd respondent’s advocate further confessed to the court on 3/10/2023 that the officials were changed and they have not been able to access the new officials, he nevertheless supports the application by the 3rd applicant’s and associates himself with their submissions.
The appellants further submitted that Article 41 of the Constitution, it need not be belabored that a cause of action against a Constitutional right arises on a daily basis as long as that right is infringed and cannot be barred by time. That the court should invoke its supervisory powers and determine for itself if the matters the Tribunal seeks to spend precious judicial time upon have been barred by statute and/or abated and proceed in the interest of justice instead of being fettered by procedural technicalities which are denounced under Article 159 of the Constitution. 
The issues for determination are:",court,56.41%,model
"The issues for determination are:
Whether the appeal should be struck off.
Whether the memorandum of appeal is statute time barred.
On the issue as to whether this appeal should be struck out, I find that the 3rd respondent submitted that the appeal was filed out of time.
I find that the said issue is one to be canvassed during the appeal.
On the issue as to whether the appeal is statute barred, again I find that the same can be canvassed during the appeal.
I find that striking out of a case no matter how hopeless should be the last resort of the court.
 In the case of Stecol Corporation Limited v Susan Awuor Mudemb [2021] eKLR the court held as follows;
“In Kamlesh Mansukhalal Damki Patni Vs Director of Public Prosecution & 3 Others [2015]eKLR, the Court of Appeal articulated that:
 “It suffices to comment that a court of law should be hesitant at closing the door to the corridors of justice prior to a litigant being heard on his complaint.”
I dismiss the application dated 31/1/2015 and direct that the parties file their submissions for determination of the main appeal.

(Being an application for extension of time for filing of a Notice of Appeal and Record of Appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Bungoma (R.E Ogola, J.) dated 25th April 2023
in
Election Civil Appeal No. E002 of 2022)
***********************************
RULING
By a Notice of Motion dated 19th July 2023, brought under rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules, supported by an affidavit of even date, sworn by Richard Jesome Wasike, the applicant prays that this Court extends time for filing of a Notice of Appeal and Record of Appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Bungoma (R.E Ogola, J.) delivered on 25th April, 2023 in Bungoma High Court Election Civil Appeal No. E002 of 2022.
The applicant prays that this Court, be pleased to extend time for service of the Notice of Appeal, Record of Appeal and letter bespeaking typed proceedings; and the costs of and incidental to this application to abide the result of the intended appeal.",court,56.17%,model
"A brief background to this matter will help put issues in perspective. The applicant herein participated in the General Elections held on 9th August 2022, and was one of the candidates seeking to be elected as a member of the county Assembly of Bungoma for Bukembe West Ward. On 11th August 2022 the 1st respondent was declared the winner of the elections. The applicant was aggrieved by the declaration and on 7th September 2022, filed an election petition CMCC Election Civil Appeal No. 2 of 2022 in the Magistrate’s Court at Bungoma, contesting the election of a Member of the County Assembly; he subsequently filed an amended petition on 7th October 2022. On 21st October 2022, the 1st respondent filed a notice of motion application dated 19th October 2022 seeking to have the petition struck out in its entirety on the basis that the affidavits in support of the petition were filed out of statutory timelines and the
petitioner’s affidavit in support of the petition was commissioned by an advocate who did not have a practicing certificate hence incompetent.
The application was heard, and the trial court rendered its ruling and struck out the petition in its entirety vide a ruling delivered on 15th November 2022. Upon the matter being dismissed, he filed Bungoma High Court Election Civil Appeal No. E002 of 2022. The matter was heard, and judgment delivered on 25th April 2023, wherein the petition was dismissed for being incurably defective in failing to comply with the Elections (Parliamentary and County Elections) Petition Rules 2017.
The applicant being dissatisfied with the judgment explains that immediately after delivery of the judgment, counsel in conduct of the matter failed to update him on the recourse that was to be taken despite the applicant giving counsel instructions to proceed with lodging an appeal, file a notice of appeal and also file an application for stay of execution. According to the applicant, he kept on checking with his advocates to know the status of the matter, and he eventually concluded that the only reason why his advocates were taking
him in circles, and not filing the appeal after delivery of the judgment, was that they had been compromised.",court,54.94%,model
"The applicant thus decided to engage another advocate, being Nabibia and Co Advocates, but time for filing a notice of appeal, record of appeal, service of letter bespeaking proceedings and service of notice of appeal and record of appeal had lapsed; yet he has a genuine interest to pursue the appeal; that he has also written to the deputy registrar of the High Court seeking typed and certified proceedings. He describes his appeal as merited and has high chances of success.
In opposing the application, the 1st respondent through the replying affidavit dated 16th October 2023, sworn by Anthony Lusenaka contends that rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules does not apply to Election Petitions which have timelines stipulated in the Constitution of Kenya as well as the Elections Act, thus stripping this Court of jurisdiction in the matter; that in any event the reasons given for delay are laced with unproven allegations intended to malign the former advocates on record; and do not meet the threshold to warrant extending the time within which to file the appeal.
In his written submissions, the applicant takes a more reconciliatory tone and says that his counsel inadvertently failed to file and lodge an appeal against the Judgment despite firm instructions to do so. He urges this Court to hold that the mistakes of counsel should not be visited on a litigant, unless both are out to mislead the Court, which is not the case in this instance. He maintains that rule 4 clothes this Court with jurisdiction to entertain his application; and refers to the case of Nicholas Kiptoo_Arap Korir Salat vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 7 Others [2014] eKLR, to reiterate the principles that guide the courts when dealing with applications for extension of time.
The 1st respondent submits that this Court lacks the jurisdiction to hear the matter ab intio, and refers to the provisions of section 75(1A) of the Elections Act No. 24 of 2011 as read together with section 75(4), which provides that appeals from the decision of the magistrate’s court challenging the validity of election results in the position for member of the County Assembly lie in the High Court on issues of law only.",court,55.32%,model
"In addition, the 1st respondent refers to 85 of the Election Act which provides that appeals to the Court of Appeal from the High Court are in relation cases challenging results in the positions of National Assembly, Senate and County Governor. It is argued that the express omission of the position of County Assembly in section 85 shows that the legislature’s intention was to bring an end to litigation, so that the decision of the High Court is final and there is no right of a second appeal to this Court.
This Court’s attention is drawn to the constitutional underpinning that election petitions be heard expeditiously and are time bound, so that those elected can concentrate and serve the people instead of being embroiled in court cases for a long time; and there is no right to a further appeal. In support of this proposition the 1st respondent refers to the case of Council of County Governors vs. The Attorney General and Another (2017) eKLR.
The second issue that is raised relates to whether this Court has jurisdiction to enlarge time for hearing of an election petition. The 1st respondent submits that Article 87 of the Constitution provides that Parliament shall enact legislation
to establish mechanisms for timely settling of election disputes. and pursuant to this provision section 75(2) provides that election petitions shall be heard and determined within six months from the date of filing the petition. It is argued that the court has no jurisdiction to extend the statutory timelines for hearing of the petition.
Drawing from the Supreme Court’s decision in Martha Wangari Karua vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 3 Others [2019] eKLR , the 1st respondent contends that a substantive hearing of an Election Petition cannot continue where the timelines for hearing a petition have already lapsed. The respondent argues that in this instance, the Petition was struck out in its entirety vide an application. The petition did not proceed to a full hearing, this, therefore, means that this appeal seeks to have the proceedings in the lower court reopened after the statutory timeline of hearing a petition of six months has elapsed.
Ultimately, the 1st respondent submits that the applicant has not met the minimum principles that a party must prove to be granted orders under rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules",court,57.27%,model
"as were laid down in the case of Nicholas Kiptoo Arap Korir Salat vs Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 7 Others (Supra) in this case, there has been an inordinate delay since Election Petitions are time-bound and there is a need for compliance. Reference is made to rule 6(2) of the Court of Appeal (Election Petition) Rules 2017 which provide that a notice of appeal is to be lodged within 7 days of the decision appealed against and be served on all parties within 5 days of filing under rule 7; that in this case, even the notice of appeal has not been filed; yet the decision was rendered on 25th April, 2023 which is 4 months down the line. That even if the court were to grant the orders sought there is no sufficient time to hear and determine the appeal since Rule 23 of the Court of Appeal Election Petition Rules 2017 provides that an appeal must be heard and determined within six months from the date of the judgment of the High Court. Four months have already elapsed from the date of the judgment.
It is also pointed out that the applicant has confirmed in his supporting affidavit that the High Court proceedings have not been typed, he has not even annexed the letter requesting for
the typing and payment of the same; and he has not given plausible reason for the delay as he has not produced any evidence to even show that he had given instructions to his advocate to appeal. The sum total of the applicant’s submissions is that there is no petition properly before the court that can be re-opened and the court will be acting in futility.
The first clarification that need to be is that the Judge who heard the appeal in the High court at Bungoma is R E. Ougo",court,55.99%,model
"J. and not R. E Ogolla, J, actually there is no Judge who goes by that identification. The second thing I take note of, as pointed out by the 1st respondent, is that the applicant filed his Petition in the Magistrate’s Court on 7th September 2022; and indeed, echo the question the observation made regarding profound juridical significance of this date in the determination of the question of whether there is any more to be done by this or any other Court after 7th March 2022. There is no gainsaying that an election petition must be heard and determined within six months from the date of filing of the petition, after which proceedings in an election petition become a nullity if it has not been determined.
The applicant blames his previous counsel for failing to act, although there is no a single document presented to confirm that he had indeed given instructions. But with greatest respect, I think I am even being too indulgent to address that, because as was pointed out in the now oft cited case of
 Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR, that jurisdiction is everything, and I must first address the question as to whether I even have jurisdiction to deal with an intended appeal arising from a disputed election of a Member of the County Assembly. In the event that statutory provisions and emerging jurisprudence frowns upon me inking my way in the matter, then I must do what the late Justice Nyarangi said in the M.V. Lillian case (supra) – that:
“… Where a court has no jurisdiction, there would be no basis for a continuation of proceedings pending the evidence. A court of law downs tools in respect of the matter before it the moment it holds the opinion that it is without jurisdiction.”
It would thus mean that upon determining the status of this court in handling this matter, the ink in my pen must suddenly dry, and not take one step further. That is what would even cloth me with the temerity to even deign to
consider the applicability of rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules in election petitions.
Starting with the statutory provisions on appeals from county elections petitions filed at the Magistrate’s court, sections 75(4) of the Elections Act provides as follows:",court,56.25%,model
"An appeal under subsection (1A) shall lie to the High Court on matters of law only and shall be:
filed within thirty days of the decision of the
Magistrate’s Court; and
heard and determined within six months from the date of filing of the appeal.
The jurisdiction of this Court to hear election appeals is found in section 85A of the Elections Act which states:
(1) An appeal from the High Court in an election petition concerning membership of National Assembly, Senate or the office of County Governor, shall lie to the court on matters of law only.
My understanding is that the two provisions I have adverted to, expressly provide that appeals regarding the election or nomination of members of the County Assembly at the High Court address matters of law only, clearly suggests that those appeals terminate at the High Court. This is fortified by the fact that significantly, the County Assembly is not included
under section 85A of the Election Act, as it was the intention of Parliament that the High Court was the last port of call on matters pertaining to elections to the County Assembly, as provided for under section 75(4) of the Election Act.
The issue as to whether the Court of Appeal can entertain a second appeal regarding the election of a Member of County Assembly in the absence of an express Constitutional and/or statutory provision conferring jurisdiction on the Court of appeal has been the subject of judicial pronouncements in several case. Indeed, the Supreme Court has definitively ruled on the issue in Hamdia Yaroi Shek Nuri vs. Faith Tumaini Kombe, Amani National Congress & Independent Electoral & Boundaries Commission [2019] eKLR, the apex Court agreed with this Court that in the absence of an express statutory provision, no second appeal lies in the Court of Appeal from the High Court, on matters regarding the question of validity of the election of a member of the County Assembly.
The key issue that the Supreme Court sought to answer was whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from the High Court (being a second appeal)",court,57.39%,model
"emanating from an election of a member of a County Assembly. In reaching its verdict, the Supreme Court directly took up the question whether the silence in section 75(4) and non-inclusion in section 85(A) of the Elections Act notwithstanding, a right of appeal still lies to the Court of Appeal from the High Court, in an election petition concerning membership of a County Assembly, in view of Article 164(3) of the Constitution. After citing its earlier decisions on the constitutional validity of the restrictions placed in the number, length and costs of electoral disputes by statute by section 85A of the Elections Act (see, for example, Gatirau Peter Munya vs. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 Others Supreme Court Petition NO. 2B of 2014), the Supreme Court stridently put the matter to rest in the following words:
….[I]t is not difficult to critically advert to such argumentation, as would question the constitutional validity of sections 85A and 75(4) of the Elections Act. In this context, the starting point, in our view, must be Article 87 of the Constitution, pursuant to which parliament is majestically charged with the duty of enacting legislation to ‘establish mechanisms for the timely settling of electoral disputes.’ The fact that the Constitution lays a fundamental premium on the need for the expeditious disposal of electoral disputes, is self-evidence in the plain language of Article 87……",court,56.68%,model
"It has to be noted that, what Article 87 requires parliament to do, is not limited to the enactment of legislation setting ‘timelines’ for the disposition of electoral disputes. The Article talks of ‘mechanisms for the timely’ settlement of electoral disputes. As such, the setting of timelines in legislation is just but one of the mechanisms for the timely settlement of electoral disputes. Other mechanisms, are discernible in the other provisions of the Elections Act touching upon such other matters, as the form of petitions, manner of service of petitions, the scope of appeals, and, in our view, the level of appeals among others. As long as these ‘mechanisms’ are not inconsistent with, or violation of the provisions of the Constitution, and as long as they are in accord with Article 87 of the Constitution, their validity cannot be questioned….To argue that, notwithstanding the non-provision for a second appeal in section 75(4) of the Elections Act, such right of appeal nonetheless subsists under Article 87 of the Constitution.
Not to be left behind, and indeed a bolster to that jurisprudence, is this Court has made pronouncements in several decisions such as Mohamed Ali Sheikh vs. Abdiwahab Sheikh & 4 Others, Hassan Jimal Abdi vs. Ibrahim Noor Hussein & 2 Others; Twaher Abdukadirim Mohammed vs. Mwathethe Adamson Kadenge & 2 Others [2015 eKLR; Emmanuel Changawa Kombe (Interested Party) [2018] eKLR; and Mogesi Agnes Bange & 8 Others vs. IEBC & 12 Others [2018 eKLR; Isaac Oerri Abiri vs.
 Samwel Nyang’au Nyanchama & 2 Others [2014]  eKLR.
All these  cases  have  held  that the  Court of Appeal has no
jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal from the High Court regarding the question of validity of the election of a Member of the County Assembly. In the decisions cited, both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal also confirmed that the omission of a provision for a second or further appeal under section 75(4) of the Elections Act was deliberate.",court,53.80%,model
"I need not say more, this application would have nowhere to begin, not even one toe on which to pretend to stand, there would be no basis of granting leave to appeal on a matter which has no authority to close it as such. Consequently, I hold and find that the application for extension of time within which to file and serve the Notice of appeal and record of appeal, have no justification. The application lacks merit and is thus dismissed with costs to the 1st respondent.

RULING
Before me is an application by way of Notice of Motion dated 16th September 2023 filed under Section 1A, 1B, 3, 3A, 79G and 95 of the Civil Procedure Act (Cap.21), and Order 22 Rule 22, Order 42 Rule 6, Order 50 Rule 6 and Order 51 Rules 1 and 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010. 
The prayers in the application are as follows:- 
(Spent).
(Spent).
(Spent).
That this honorable court be pleased to stay execution and proceedings of the judgment from Wundanyi Civil Suit No. 51 of 2021 pending the hearing and determination of this appeal herein.
That the costs of this application abide the outcome of the appeal.
The application was filed with a supporting affidavit sworn by Nassanga Sophie Advocate for the applicant on 16th September 2023, in which it was deponed that the initial stay of execution orders granted lapsed on 11th September 2023. 
The application is opposed through a replying affidavit sworn by the respondent on 27th September 2023 in which it was deponed that the applicant had not demonstrated the substantial loss he will suffer if the stay orders sought are not granted.
The application was canvassed through written submissions.  In this regard, I have perused and considered the submissions filed by Kimondo Gachoka & Company Advocates for the appellant/applicant, as well as the submissions filed by Njoroge Mwangi & Company for the respondent.",court,55.73%,model
"Let me put it on record here that I have neither been availed the trial court file, nor the trial court judgment.  However, paragraph 2 of the Memorandum of Appeal refers to an award of Kshs. 200,000/= general damages plus Kshs. 2,550/= special damages.  This being an application for stay of execution of judgment or decree, it is governed by the provisions of Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules, especially Rule 6(2) which states as follows:-
“6 (2) No order for stay of execution shall be made under sub rule (1) unless:-
The court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay and;
Such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.”
Though the applicant’s counsel has submitted that one of the considerations is whether the appeal has high chances of success, in my view such is not a requirement for an application for stay of execution filed in the High Court, though it might be so in the Court of Appeal.
Was the application herein filed without unreasonable delay?  In this regard, I note that the judgment was delivered on 28th July 2023 and this application filed on 16th September 2023 a period of less than two months.  In the circumstances of this case therefore, I find that there was no unreasonable delay in filing this application.
I now turn to the consideration as to whether the applicant is likely to suffer substantial loss if the stay orders sought are not granted. I note that this is a matter relating to a monetary decree arising from a traffic accident, and that the appeal is mainly on the quantum of damages awarded.  It is also acknowledged that the respondent was a passenger in a motor vehicle when the accident occurred.",court,57.82%,model
"In those circumstances, I find that the applicant is likely to suffer substantial loss only if the entire amount of award by trial court is paid, and then the appeal succeeds and they find it difficult to recover the same.  I thus find that stay of execution can only be justified if the applicant pays part of the decretal amount to the respondent.  The total monetary award being Kshs. 202,500/=, I will order payment of Kshs. 80,000/=as a condition for granting stay orders.
With regard to provision of security, in my view the part payment of the decretal amount above will constitute adequate security.
For the above reasons, I allow this application on the following terms:-
Stay of execution of judgment or decree pending determination of appeal is hereby granted, subject to the appellant/applicant paying part of the decretal amount Kshs. 80,000/= to the respondent through counsel within 45 days from today.
If the payment of Kshs. 80,000/= is not effected within 45 days from today, the stay orders herein granted will automatically lapse and have no effect.
The costs of the application will abide the results of the appeal.

"JUDGMENT
The claimant filed the statement of claim amended on 24.02.2021 through Musesya & Company Advocates. The claimant allergec that she was employed by the respondent on20.01.2016 as a Systems Administration and Product in Data Processing Administrator. She pleaded that her monthly gross payment was Kshs.207,376.00 and net salary was Kshs.150,000.00. Her further case was pleaded as follows. By a letter dated 01.07.2018 she gave the respondent a one-month notice to resign from employment effective 27.07.2018. The resignation letter was dated 01.07.2018 but was delivered to the respondent on 01.06.2018. After receiving the letter, the respondent replied by the letter dated 27.06.2018 accepting to pay the claimant terminal dues including salary up to 31.07.2018; salary arrears for month of March – June 2018; any outstanding arrears for the year 2017. On 27.07.2018 the claimant left the respondent’s employment and demanded the payment of her final dues as was stated in the respondent’s letter dated 27.06.2018. The claim is for the unpaid dues per letter dated 27.06.2018. Further claim is for deducted but unremitted NHIF, NSSF, and, PAYE. The claimant alleges that the respondent breached section 18(2) (b) of the Employment Act, 2007 which provides that wages or salary is deemed due at end of a period of a month and, section 18(5) (a) that upon termination of a contract of service by effluxion of time, the employer shall ensure that the employee is paid entire amount of the wages earned by or payable to the employee and of allowances due to him as have not been paid. The claimant claimed as follows:
2017 salary arrears Kshs.134, 508.00.
March 2018 salary arrears Kshs.66,334.00.
April – July 2018 salary arrears 150,667 x 4 =Kshs.602,668.00.",court,50.41%,model
"Unremitted NHIF from date of employment Kshs.500 x 9 months = Kshs.9,500.00.
Unremitted NSSF from the date of employment Kshs.200 x 19 months = Kshs.3,800.00.
Unremitted PAYE from date of employment Kshs.54,809 x 7 = Kshs.383,663.00.
Total claim = Kshs.1,200,473.00.
The claimant prayed for judgment against the respondent for:
Payment of the Kshs.1,200,000.00 plus interest from 01.08.2018 till payment in full.
To remit NSSF, NHIF, and PAYE within 14 days of the judgment and to issue a certificate of statutory deductions for 05.03.2018 to 31.08.2018.
Issuance of certificate of service.
Costs of the suit.
Any further orders as the Court may deem just.
The respondent filed the defense and response to claim dated25.03.2021 through L. Kimondo & Company Advocates. The respondent pleaded as follows. The respondent denied that it employed the claimant in January 2016 or at all.  There was no letter of appointment and there being no contract of employment the respondent could not have paid the claimant a sum of Kshs.150, 667.00 in monthly salary. The respondent was not aware of the payslip for January 2018, Further, the claimant’s account and case was not believable such as, the resignation letter was dated 01.07.2018; alleged respondent’s acknowledgment was dated 27.06.2018 being a date earlier than the alleged resignation letter; her resignation letter and alleged acceptance have differing effective dates of the resignation; and all claims were therefore denied. In any event the claimant’s alleged letter of resignation did not mention the alleged salary arrears. The respondent urged that the claim was frivolous and it be dismissed with costs.
The claimant testified to support her case. The respondent did not call a witness. Final submissions were filed for the parties. The Court has considered the material on record and returns as follows.",court,52.21%,model
"The 1st issue is whether parties were in a contract of service. The claimant testified that she was not issued with a letter of appointment. However, she testified that it was agreed that she earns Kshs.207,376 gross monthly salary. The Court considers that if the contract of service was oral, then it was necessary that the claimant identifies the respondent’s director, manager or other responsible officer with whom the alleged oral contract of employment may have been concluded on 20.01.2016 as is alleged. The Court therefore returns that the claimant has failed to show that the respondent company indeed employed her. The failure to detail the person who bound the respondent in the alleged oral contract of service together with the discrepancies in the dates of the alleged resignation letter and alleged acceptance letter and discrepancies in the effective dates of resignation and no mention of the alleged salaries arrears in the resignation letter and as pleaded for the respondent all make the claimant’s account and case not believable on a balance of probabilities. Her case will fail upon the finding that she has failed to show that there existed an oral or other contract of service between the parties. The respondent’s case is upheld.
In conclusion, judgment is hereby entered for the respondent against the claimant for dismissal of the suit with costs.

This is a very old matter. The plaintiffs instituted this suit against the defendants through a plaint dated 10/6/1985 and amended on 10/6/1991. They sought judgment against the defendants for an injunction restraining them from transferring or otherwise disposing of L.R. No. Aguthi/Gaki/1064, that the said L.R. No. Aguthi/Gaki/1064 (“the suit property”) be transferred back to the 1st plaintiff plus general damages and costs.
It was the plaintiffs’ case that the 1st plaintiff was the registered owner of the suit property measuring approximately 4 acres. That in January, 1983, the 1st defendant advanced the 2nd defendant a loan of Kshs.50,000/- which was guaranteed by the 1st plaintiff with the suit property being offered as security.  That it was a term of the charge and guarantee that the 1st plaintiff would be notified of any default before the security for the loan could be realized.",court,54.02%,model
"The plaintiffs contended that, on the instructions of the 1st defendant, the 2nd defendant sold the suit property to the 3rd defendant without notice to them. That the 2nd defendant was negligent in selling the suit property because the advertisement for sale was not circulated in good time, the proclamation notice was not affixed on the suit property and for failure to receive 25% of the purchase price upon the fall of the hammer. As a result of the foregoing, the plaintiffs claimed that they had suffered loss and damage.
In opposition to the suit, the defendants filed a statement of defence dated 29/4/1998 and an Amended defence dated 19/6/1991. It was contended that the 2nd plaintiff was advanced a loan of Kshs 50,000/- by the 1st defendant but fell into arrears. That the 1st defendant wrote to the 2nd plaintiff through its advocates demanding the outstanding sum of Kshs 36,811.75 however the 2nd plaintiff failed to make any payment. 
That vide a letter dated 20/6/1984, the 1st plaintiff admitted liability and stated that he would personally offset the loan in the event the 2nd plaintiff did not clear the said sum. That on the 1st defendant’s instructions, the auctioneer issued the plaintiffs with the 3months statutory notice of sale on 17/10/1984 pursuant to which the suit property was sold through an auction on 10/4/1985.
It was contended that the 2nd defendant circulated the sale advertisement in good time and affixed the proclamation notice on the suit property. That the 1st and 2nd defendant visited the property before the sale and the 2nd defendant received 25% of the purchase price at the fall of the hammer.
The 3rd defendant filed his defence on 12/4/1988 wherein he stated that he purchased the suit property in a public auction. He contended that he was a bonafide purchaser for value and by virtue of section 77(3) of the Registered Land Act the plaintiffs could not maintain any claim against him.",court,54.33%,model
"From the record, the suit was heard by Bosire J (as he then was) on 22/6/1992, 23/6/1992, 28/9/1992 and 16/11/1992. The plaintiff’s witnesses closed their case while the 1st defendant’s witness testified in chief and was stood down during cross-examination. He never returned to complete his testimony. The record shows that the matter remained in limbo from 10/2/1993 until 8/3/2010. 
On 2/11/2011, Mwera J ordered that the proceedings be typed and the matter proceeds before any Judge. In 2014, the matter was transferred to the Environment and Land Court but was re-transferred back to the Commercial Division. After several mentions, on 30/9/2015, the 1st defendant informed the Court that it could not trace its witness and therefore applied to file an alternative witness statement. Ochieng J (as he then was) granted the leave sought. A witness statement of Eunice Mwikali Kiawa was filed on 18/1/2016.
On 3/6/2019, the Court was informed that the 2nd defendant had passed on and the suit against him had abated. The 1st defendant then informed the Court that its witness had travelled to Uganda and was unavailable to testify. The matter was then adjourned and on 4/11/2019, the 1st defendant closed its case without calling its witness. Kasango J then directed the parties to file their submissions. Only the 1st defendant who filed the same. Apart from the initial stages, the 3rd defendant seems not to have participated in this suit.
On 22/9/2021, I took over the matter and had the task of writing the judgment on the material on record.
During the hearing, the plaintiff called three witness. The 1st plaintiff ANTHONY GREGORY WAMAHIU testified as (Pw1). He stated that he became aware of the sale when a person who identified himself as the buyer visited the suit property.",court,55.61%,model
"That he was not notified of the sale and the suit property had been sold at an undervalue. According to him, the suit property had been valued at Kshs. 160,000/- but the bank sold it at Kshs. 55,000/- and no reserve price was fixed at the time of sale. That a recent valuation done showed the value of the property to have been Kshs. 343,000/- as at April, 1985 when the property was sold.
 That the 3rd defendant was related to him as they belonged to the same clan and he should have therefore notified him of the intended sale. That he wanted to pay back the purchase price but the 3rd defendant demanded for more money. He was still in possession of the suit property.
PW2 REUBEN KARIUKI KAIRU stated that there were irregularities in the sale of the suit property. That the clan had contributed money to repay the loan. He admitted having defaulted paying the loan. He stated that only the 3rd defendant who attended the sale. There was no one who mentioned the auction sale. 
PW3 JOSEPHAT SHADRACK MUREITHI stated that he undertook valuation of the suit property on 29/5/1992 whereby he valued it at Kshs. 433,000/-. That the value of the property in 1985 would have been Kshs. 343,000/-. 
Since the testimony of JOSHUA AIRO KOYO who testified for the bank was abandoned and replaced with Eunice Mwikali Kiawa, his testimony does not fall for consideration. She stated that joined the bank in 2007. That the property had been offered as security. That on 28/12/1983, the bank’s advocates demanded full repayment from the 2nd plaintiff of Kshs.36,811/75. That the bank demanded from the 1st plaintiff the outstanding amount on 28/5/1984 and the advocates issued him with a statutory notice on 17/10/1984.
That the 2nd defendant did issue the 45day notification of sale and duly advertised the property for sale. That at the time of the sale of the property, the outstanding amount was Kshs.42,696/80.",court,52.81%,model
"I have considered, the pleadings, the oral testimony and the submissions on record.  The only issue I find for determination is whether the suit property was validly sold. The complaint by the 1st plaintiff was that he was not notified of the intended sale and the sale itself. That the sale was at an undervalue.
On its part, the 1st defendant stated that there was default, it duly demanded for the amounts due, advertised the intended sale of the suit property and had the hand bills of the sale of the property distributed in Nyeri town before the subject sale took place. 
Section 74 of the Registered Land Act (RLA) Cap 300 (now repealed) provided at subsections (1) and (2) as follows: -
“74 (1)■If default is made in payment of the principal sum or of any interest or any other periodical payment or of any part thereof, or in the performance or observance of any agreement expressed or implied in any charge, and continues for one month, the chargee may serve on the chargor notice in writing to pay the money owing or to perform and observe the agreement as the case may be. 
(2)■If the chargor does not comply, within three months of the date of service, with a notice served on him under sub section (1) the chargee may -:
(a)■… 
(b) sell the charged property.”
There was no dispute that there was default. The contest was in the manner in which the suit property was sold. On one hand they challenged the receipt of the notices and on the other hand it was pleaded that the property was sold at an undervalue. 
With respect to service of the notices, the Court of appeal held in Stephen Boro Gitiha v Nicholas Ruthiru Gatoto & 2 others [2017] eKLR that: -",court,54.67%,model
"“The case at hand is on all fours with that decision in (Ochieng and Another vs Ochieng and Others, Civil Appeal No. 148 of 1995 EALR (supra)) and the conclusions the learned Judge arrived at were therefore correct in law. Section 74(1) of the RLA was designed to offer protection to chargors by protecting them from situations where their property would be disposed of without the requisite notice. It was a right conferred by statute and the courts could not lightly treat or minimize any breach of the said right. Auction sales not preceded by the requisite statutory notice were not mere irregularities. They were unlawful, null and void, and incapable of passing effective and proper title to the purchasers, as illegality cannot engender legal title. The learned Judge was right to find and hold that innocence of Gitahi’s purchase was not curative of the fundamental defect in the title due to the absence of the requisite notice.”
The same Court had Nyangilo Ochieng & Another – And – Fanuel B. Ochieng Civil Appeal No. 148 OF 1995 held that: -
“It is trite that before a chargee can exercise his/her/ its statutory power of sale there must be compliance with section 74 (1) of the Registered Land Act (Cap 300, Laws of Kenya) This section obliges the chargee to serve, by registered post, the relevant statutory notice…..it is for the chargee to make sure that there is compliance with the requirements of section 74 (1) ……that burden is not in any manner on the chargor.  Once the chargor alleges non receipt of the statutory notice it is for the chargee to prove that such notice was in fact sent.”
The same position was adopted in Simiyu vs. Housing Finance Company of Kenta [2001] 2 E.A. 540 at 548, wherein Ringera J held: -",court,55.40%,model
"“The above understanding of pertinent provisions of the RLA and the Auctioneers Rules leads me to the conclusion that the service of both an adequate statutory notice and a notification of sale are necessary conditions precedent for the valid exercise of the statutory power of sale under RLA.  Without compliance with those statutory commands, there can be no valid exercise of the power of sale and accordingly it cannot be said that the chargor's equity of redemption is extinguished in any sale conducted in breach thereof.  Neither can it be properly contended that the chargor's remedy, if any such sale has taken place, is in damages as provided in section 77 (3) of the Act.  Without compliance with those conditions precedent, the purported sale would be void and liable to be nullified at the instance of the chargor.  Taking that view of the matter, I find that the Plaintiff has shown a prima facie case with a probability of success at the trial, that the sale of her property may be declared illegal, null and void as she craves.""
In view of the foregoing dictums, once the service of the notices was challenged, the burden of proof was on the 1st and 2nd defendants to demonstrate that, there were statutory notices that were correctly issued and served. My understanding of the law is that, a valid statutory notice must specifically state that if the default continues after 90days of service of such notice, the property shall be sold. A sorter notice won’t do even if default continues for-ever!
In the present case, firstly, the 1st and 2nd defendant did not offer any evidence to challenge that of the plaintiffs that no statutory notice had been served. Service of the statutory notice was a pre-condition to the exercise of the statutory power of sale. 
In the premises, failure of the 1st defendant to exhibit any documentary evidence such as certificate of posting or any documentary evidence to show that the statutory notice and notification of sale was served upon the 1st plaintiff means that the defendants have not discharged the burden of proof. 
In line with the case Stephen Boro Gitiha v Nicholas Ruthiru Gatoto & 2 others (supra) failure to serve the documents is a violation of section 74 of the RLA(repealed) which in turn meant that the subsequent sale was unlawful null and void.",court,55.17%,model
"The second challenge was that the auction was irregular. Although it was admitted that there was some advertisement in the Kenya Times Newspaper, there was no evidence that the 45day notice was ever served. The 1st plaintiff also indicated that there was no auction per ce as only the 3rd defendant who attended the sale. That cannot be said to be an auction. That assertion was neither challenged nor denied.
The question is, was there a public auction in which the sale took place? Can it be said that the sale went to the highest bidder and therefore extinguished the plaintiffs’ equity of redemption. The Court entertains doubts. 
Black’s Law Dictionary, 10th Edn, at page 155 defines an auction as follows: -
“A public sale of property to the highest bidder; a sale by consecutive bidding, intended to reach the highest price of the article through competition for it ...”
From the evidence of the auctioneer, there was only one bidder whose bid was accepted. The said bidder only competed with himself. Can it be said that there was successive bidding with a view to reach the highest price in the circumstances? I entertain doubt.
In the premises, the court finds that there was no public auction by which the 3rd defendant could be said to be an innocent purchaser for value. The said was void in view of the violation of statute. 
 There was also the issue of the under value of the property.  The forced sale value in 1982 was Kshs. 80,000/= on the basis of which the loan was advanced.  Come the sale, the suit property was allegedly sold for a parlty sum of Kshs. 55000/=.  That was an undervalue.  The 4th defendant did not produce any evidence to show that it valued the property before the sale.
I find that the plaintiffs’ suit has been proved to the required standard and I allow the same as follows: -
The purported sale of the suit property L.R. No. Aguthi/Gaki/1064 is hereby declared null and void.
The suit property be re-transferred back to the 1st plaintiff.",court,53.97%,model
"The suit property be re-transferred back to the 1st plaintiff.
The plaintiffs to pay off to the 1st defendant the outstanding amount, which stood at Kshs.40,899/85 together with interest thereon at 14% pa from 29/9/1984 until payment in full, subject however, to the doctrine and principle of the in duplum rule.
Due to the fact that the plaintiffs were in default and the circumstances of the case, I will make no order as to costs.
It is so decreed.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 461 OF 2011
TOM K’OPERE trading as T. O
K’OPERE & CO. ADVOCATES.............................. APPELLANT
-VERSUS-
THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE
OF THE LSK...............................................1ST RESPONDENT
SISTER MARY DOMINIC SAVIO AKOTH.... 2ND RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the judgment of the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society of Kenya given on 12/09/2011 in D. C. no. 26of 2011)
JUDGMENT
The 2nd respondent filed a complaint against the appellant at the Laws Society of Kenya being D.C. No. 26 of 2011.
The complaint was in respect of the appellant’s failure to release to the 2nd respondent’s documents received by his firm on behalf of the 2nd respondent.
The documents were in respect of land parcel TITLE NO. WESTKASIPUL/KARABACH/599 (hereafter referred to as the suit property) situated at Rachuonyo which the 2nd  respondent allegedly bought by way or public auction from National Bank of Kenya(NBK).
A brief background of this case was that the owner of the suit property (Richard Omanya (now deceased)) charged the suit property to the National bank of Kenya (NBK) to secure a loan of kshs.300,000.
The deceased was running a school at the suit property which collapsed and the deceased converted it into a health centre.
When the health centre did not do well, the deceased leased the health centre to the second respondent.
The deceased was unable to service the loan and the bank (NBK) invoked its statutory power of sale.
The appellant thereafter participated in negotiations between the family of the deceased and the 2nd respondent in which the 2nd respondent offered to buy 5 acres of the suit property comprising the Health centre for ksh.3,000,000.
Subsequently the 2nd complainant purchased the entire suit property at an auction held on 7/12/2001 at Kshs. 1,500,000.",court,54.24%,model
"The appellant refused to release the documents he was holding in respect of the suit property and the 2nd respondent filed the complaint at the LSK on 16/3/2011.
The 1st respondent found that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct for reasons that he released the title documents of the suit property to one of the parties after acting for both the family of the deceased and the 2nd respondent in the transaction.
The 1st respondent said that as advocate acting for both parties, the appellant was under a duty to balance the parties’ interests and not to favour one party over another.
The 1st respondent also stated in their judgment that the appellant was in breach of his professional responsibility by releasing the title documents of the suit property to one of the parties.
The 1st respondent said that the appellant ought to have returned the documents to the bank (NBK) instead of releasing them to the family of the deceased.
The Appellant filed an interpleader suit in Nairobi and the case was transferred to Kisumu ELC court where it was determined.
The appellant is aggrieved with the decision of the 1st respondent and he filed this appeal on the following grounds;
The entire judgment/order/conviction is contrary to law in that it totally ignores the Provisions of the Land Control act – Cap 302 Laws of Kenya and more specifically Sections 6, 8 and 22 thereof in the manner the advocate made his decision not to release the title documents to the complainants.
The Disciplinary committee erred both in law and fact in holding that the appellant/advocate withheld completion documents of a transaction which transaction was void in law and any furtherance thereof would constitute a criminal offence in terms of Section 22 of the Land Control Act there being no consent from the Land Control Board as required under Section 6 and 8 thereof, no purpose would have been achieved by releasing the title documents which were still in the name of the deceased to the complainants.
The judgment/order/conviction is premised on the purport/presumption that the 2nd respondent/ complainant was a client of the appellant/advocate when there is no evidence tendered in support to show:-
Any instructions given by the 2nd respondent to the advocate, written or otherwise as by the law required.
Any direct communication between the complainants and the advocate to suggest any instructions.",court,55.90%,model
"Any direct communication between the complainants and the advocate to suggest any instructions.
Any payment of fees or commitment to pay fees so as to create advocate-client relationship.
Clear admission of fact that the advocate was representing the deceased owner of the property in dispute and thereafter the estate.
The disciplinary committee erred in law and fact in failing to consider and appreciate the undisputed and overwhelming fact that the complainants were purely nominees to the auction transaction and never participated or attended any auction sale and their name was only given by the Highest Bidder pursuant to an arrangement with the deceased family and at no time were they a client of the advocate/appellant and grossly misinterpreted the advocates letter of 04/10/06 almost two (2) years after the transaction.
The disciplinary committee erred in law and fact in failing to consider and appreciate the correspondences annexed to the advocate’s replying affidavit which clearly demonstrated that the complainants were at no time the clients of the advocate and there has never been any advocate-client relationship between the appellant and the 2nd respondent.
The disciplinary committee exceeded its jurisdiction and mandate, in purporting to determine a commercial dispute between the complainants and the estate of the deceased owner of the suit property without hearing the other parties who were involved in the transaction and clearly named in the proceedings thus rendering a decision which is ultra vires its powers and jurisdiction and further violating the fundamental rules of natural justice by deciding who was entitled to the release of the title documents in relation to Title No. West Kasipul/Karabach/599 which is still in the name of the deceased without hearing the members of the deceased family who transacted with the complainant herein.  This dispute is recognized in paragraph 16 of the judgment (page 6).
The disciplinary committee erred in law and fact in ignoring the correspondences exchanged between the complainant’s advocates and the appellant for six (6) years between 2005 and 2011 thus arriving at a wrong and absurd conclusion that the advocate failed to reply to correspondence a decision which is not supported by any logic.",court,53.04%,model
"The disciplinary committee erred in law and fact in convicting the appellant for professional misconduct when in its own finding at paragraph 21 (page 9) it recognizes that the dealings between the transaction is valid under the Land Control Act and the effect of this finding is that in the absence of any consent from the Land Control Board, and the property remaining in the name of the deceased, the only claim the complainants may have is over any sums paid towards the transaction and not the property, which confirm the position that no documents of the title could be released to the complainants.
The disciplinary committee erred in law and fact in its interpretation of Sections 55, 60 and 60a of the Advocates Act thus arriving at a wrong decision.
The judgment/order/conviction of the appellant by the disciplinary committee was arrived at based on an erroneous reasoning, failure to appreciate the facts and evidence before the committee and based on wrong conclusions.
The parties filed written submissions as follows: the appellant submitted that the disciplinary committee appreciated that there were other parties involved including the deceased’s family members, widow (consolata Omanya), the deceased daughter in law (Bertha Omanya), the charge Bank (National Bank of Kenya and the deceased daughters who took out letter of administration of the deceased estate have been enjoined in this appeal and were parties to the interpleader proceedings. None of these parties were enjoined in the primary complaint by the complainant and the disciplinary committee recognized this fact but did not hear the said parties before rendering its judgement.
The appellant argued that the Interpleader Application was very Specific on only two Prayers; the first issue was for determination of who between the 1st and 2nd Respondents was entitled to the Release of the Title Documents which had already been deposited in Court; and secondly, who between the two parties was to pay the Appellant Advocate's Costs/Fees. The trial judge in his judgment instead proceeded to frame Seven (7) Issues most of which were not relevant to the Interpleader Proceedings but the only portion which touched on the Prayers in the Originating Summons dated 27/4/12. The judge came to the finding that the suit property could not be effected to the 1st respondent as there was no valid consent and therefore the court was of the view that the property still belonged to the deceased and therefore his beneficiaries should benefit from his estate.",court,55.75%,model
"The appellant argued that this is the legal position that he took before being taken to the disciplinary committee and that is why in his letter dated 7/4/2011 indicated that there being no consent from the land control board, the transfer could not be effected and preferred to release the title documents to the deceased estate on condition that the estate make arrangements to refund the 2nd respondent the total amount paid to the charge Kshs. 1,500,000 to secure the release of the title and discharge of the property pursuant to the botched auction sale.
 The appellant indicated that the 2nd respondent had for the past six years instructed several advocates among them; Muniafu Ondari & Co. Advocates, Mose & Mose Advocates, Kiage & co. Advocates to act for them. The appellant advocate copied the letter dated 7/4/2011 to the 2nd respondent, her advocates and the secretary LSK setting out the conditions for the intended release of the title documents to the deceased family which condition was never complied with by the  deceased family forcing the advocate to continue holding the title documents until the same were deposited in court.
As relating to the issue of advocate client relationship between the appellant and the 2nd respondent the appellant argued the same was raised in the proceedings but not conclusively dealt with by the disciplinary committee. The 2nd respondent in her various affidavits confirmed that she never dealt with the appellant directly but through the two family members of the deceased and never attended the public auction sale and insisted that the appellant advocate received the title documents on their behalf but all subsequent correspondences for 6 years from 2005-2011 show that they were represented by 4 different firms of advocates.",court,52.51%,model
"The appellant argued that the action by the Appellant Advocate for which the Disciplinary Committee convicted him involved a question of Interpretation of the Law in a Transaction. The Decision of the Committee presupposes that the Advocate cannot and should not make a Legal Opinion or Decision on a mater he is acting for Two (2) Competing Clients by advising on the way forward where a provision for the Law (Section 22 of the Land Control Act) clearly stipulates a Criminal Sanction where an Advocate or Party takes a particular action in furtherance of a void transaction. To this extent the Disciplinary Committee in acknowledging the Dilemma caused by the Provisions of the Land Control Act should not have proceeded with the Hearing of the Complaint and convicted the Appellant but hold the Complaint in abeyance or decline Jurisdiction pending a Determination by the Court on the Interpretation of the Provisions of the Land Control Act through the Interpleader Proceedings. In this Case, notwithstanding the Conviction and Sentence, the Disciplinary Committee file is still open and being Mentioned after every Six (6) Months to determine what the Court has determined. This should form a basis and Justification for Setting Aside the Decision of the Disciplinary Committee for want of Jurisdiction.
In opposition the 1st respondent submitted that 2nd Respondent purchased the subject property through an auction as the property had been charged by the late Richard Omanya Adongo to National Bank of Kenya. The Appellant, who was acting for both the 2nd Respondent and the family of the deceased received the completion documents from the Bank on behalf of the 2nd Respondent and instead released the same to the family of the deceased. It is on this basis that the 1st Respondent found the Appellant guilty for professional misconduct.",court,55.01%,model
"The Appellant as the advocate for the 2nd Respondent received the purchase price for the property from the 2nd Respondent vide Cheque No. 100688 and partly through a direct deposit. Subsequently, the National bank of Kenya released the completion documents to the Appellant vide the letter dated 26/4/2005 on behalf of the 2nd Respondent. It was therefore imperative for the Appellant to release the completion documents to the 2nd Respondent who rightfully bought the subject property in a public auction. On the contrary, the Appellant released the completion documents to the family of the deceased, Richard Omanya Adongo, whom he was also acting for.
The 1st respondent argued further that it was not within the mandate of the 1st Respondent to determine the validity of the transaction. It's on this basis that the 1st Respondent only addressed the professional misconduct of the Appellant, which is within its realm. In that regard, the contention that the transaction was void in law is without merit.
The 1st respondent noted a letter dated 21/7/2006 where the appellant admitted that the 2nd respondent was his client and it was on this basis that the appellant received the documents from Legacy Auctioneering Services. It was also in his capacity as the advocate that the appellant received the purchase price vide cheque No. 100688 and partly through a direct deposit. The appellant also issued a fee not vide the letter dated 4/10/2006 to be paid by both the 2nd respondent and the family of the deceased.
The 2nd respondent in its submissions reiterated the sentiments of the 1st respondent. The 2nd respondent further argued that the appellant is attempting to hide his misconduct by invoking the provisions of section 6 and 8 of the Land Control Act. The 1st respondent has the disciplinary jurisdiction to hear and determine a complaint brought to it by any person against an advocate pursuant to section 55 of the Advocates Act.
This being a first appeal, the duty of the 1st appellate court is to re-evaluate the evidence before the Disciplinary Committee and to come up with its own conclusion whether to support the findings of the committee. In Selle –Vs- Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 it was held in the following terms: -",court,53.88%,model
"“An appeal from the High Court is by way of re-trial and the Court of Appeal is not bound to follow the trial judge’s finding of fact if it appears either that he failed to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities, or if the impression of the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence generally.
An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled.  Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect.
In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate the evidence or if the impression based on the demeanor of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”
The issues for determination in this appeal are as follows;
Whether the 2nd respondent was a client of the appellant.
Whether the 1st respondent was right in finding that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct.
Whether the 1st respondent exceeded its jurisdiction by determining a land dispute between the 2nd respondent and the family of the deceased. 
Whether the decision of the 1st respondent should be set aside.
On the issue as to whether the 2nd respondent was a client of the appellant, the 2nd respondent maintained that she was the one who had instructed the appellant to act for her in the sale transaction of the property.
The appellant denied having any client/advocate relationship with the 2nd respondent and said he did not have any written or verbal instructions to act for her.
The appellant denied that there was any direct communication between him and the 2nd respondent or payment of fees.
I have perused the proceedings correspondences and the judgment of the 1st respondent and I find that the appellant was acting for both parties.
There is evidence that the appellant participated in negotiations between the 2nd respondent and the family of the deceased for the sale of the suit property prior to the auction.
The 2nd respondent was a tenant of the deceased while the deceased was the initial client of the deceased before the sale negotiations.",court,55.89%,model
"I find that the 1st respondent was right in pointing out at paragraph 31 of their judgment that the appellant was an advocate for both the 2nd respondent and the family of the deceased.
On the issue as to whether the 1st respondent was right in finding the appellant guilty of professional misconduct, I find that the 1st respondent found that the appellant was wrong in releasing the documents to one of the parties.
The complaint filed by the 2nd respondent was in respect of withholding the documents.  In the judgment the 1st respondent found the appellant guilty of having released the same to one of the parties.
I find that the appellant deposited the documents in court by order of the court and he filed interpleader proceeding at the  NAIROBI ELC NO.220 OF 2012 which was later transferred Kisumu and it became KISUMU ELC NO. 64 OF 2019.
The said case has since been determined and it is awaiting determination of an appeal at the Court of Appeal at Kisumu being KISUMU CA 054 OF 2023.
The title documents were deposited with the Registrar of the Court of appeal by order of this court dated 15th August 2023 awaiting the determination of the appeal to the Court of Appeal.
In the circumstances, the appellant did not release the documents to one of the parties.  He may have threatened to release them but he did not do so.
I therefore find that the 1st respondent was not right in finding the appellant guilty of professional misconduct.
On the issue as to whether the 1st respondent exceeded its jurisdiction by determining a land dispute between the 2nd respondent and the family of the deceased, I find that the family of the deceased was not a party in D. C. no. 26of 2011 between the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent.
In the circumstances, the 1st Respondent did not have the mandate to decide who was entitled to the title documents of the suit property since they were made aware that there was a dispute between the 2nd Respondent and the family of the deceased. 
I accordingly allow the appeal and I set aside the decision of the 1st respondent.
On the issue of costs, I direct that each party bears its own costs of this appeal.",court,57.89%,model

RULING
The Application herein seeks revocation of a Grant.
The background of the matter is that the deceased, William Kipsagui Chepkok died intestate on 4/06/2010 at the age of 78 years. He was a polygamous man with 3 wives and was survived by 1 widow and about 18 children, both adults and minors. The deceased also left behind some parcels of land.
On 11/9/2013, the Petitioners in their capacity as sons, applied for Grant of Letters of Administration Intestate in respect of the estate. Such Grant was then issued by the Court on 25/02/2014, was subsequently confirmed on 29/11/2021 and the estate distributed. 
Now before Court for determination is the Application brought by way of the Summons dated 11/04/2022 and filed by the Objector, through Messrs Rioba Omboto & Co. Advocates. The prayers sought are as follows:
[………] Spent.
THAT the Grant of Letters of Administration intestate issued on the 25th February 2014 and confirmed on the 29th November 2021 be revoked and/or annulled.
THAT the Applicant herein be made a beneficiary of the estate of William Kipsugut Chepkok and/or the Grant be rectified to include the Objector/Applicant as a beneficiary in respect of that parcel of land namely Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7(Segoit Rock/2).",court,55.71%,model
"THAT an order to issue restraining and/or stopping the Petitioners and their agents, assignees and/or servants from intermeddling, subdividing or dealing in any way with the estate of the deceased person, more particularly L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/ (Segoit Rock/2) measuring 30 acres pending the hearing and determination of this Application inter partes and thereafter the hearing of the main cause.
Costs of this Application be provided for.
The Application is stated be brought under Section 47 and 76(e) of the Law of Succession Act, Section 44(1) and Rule 73 of the Probate and Administration Rules and “all other enabling provisions of the law”. It is premised on the grounds stated on the face thereon and is supported by the Affidavit sworn by the Objector.
In the Affidavit, the Objector deponed that the he is a grandson of the deceased hence one of the rightful and lawful dependents and beneficiaries of the estate, the Petitioners filed this Cause secretly and without his knowledge or consent and left him out knowing very well that he was raised by the deceased, his consent was not obtained, the Petitioners who are his uncles did not include him and his siblings as beneficiaries, the deceased had taken care of them since childhood and prior to his death, gave the Objector 3 acres to cultivate for his subsistence and livelihood, the 3 acres were from L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/ (Segoit Rock/2) (hereinafter referred to as “the property”) which forms part of the estate, he has resided on the property and built his homestead, even the area Chief has confirmed the same, they had family meetings after the death of the deceased, the Petitioners have been promising to distribute the 3 acres to him and that in Petition, the Petitioners also excluded his grandmother (widow to the deceased). 
He then made an illustration to demonstrate that the deceased had 3 wives including the Objector’s grandmother (Taplelei Kipsugut) who gave birth to the Objector’s mother (Rose Chepkok) who never got married but gave birth to the Objector (son) and 2 daughters.",court,55.62%,model
"In conclusion, the Objector deponed that the Petitioners sold part of the estate to one Betra Jemaiyo Cheboi who is now claiming 5 acres which forms part of the portion of land that the Objector has been occupying since childhood.
Response to the Application
The Summons is opposed vide the Replying Affidavit sworn by the 1st Petitioner, and filed on 25/07/2022 through Messrs Mburu Maina & Co. Advocates. He deponed that the Objector was not included in the mode of distribution for reason that he is not a beneficiary of the estate, they filed the Petition on the basis of consent signed by all the beneficiaries and the Court issued the Grant based on the consent, the area Chief wrote a letter listing all the beneficiaries and the Applicant was not included, the Objector did not express any intention of being included, and that the Application is an afterthought made in bad faith as the Objector has always been aware of the proceedings.
Hearing of the Application 
The Application was canvassed by way of written Submissions. Pursuant to directions given, the Objector filed his Submissions on 25/01/2023 while the Petitioners filed on 30/03/2023.
Objector’s Submissions",court,55.24%,model
"Objector’s Submissions
Counsel for the Objector submitted that the Objector is a grandchild of the deceased and is entitled to the estate by virtue of Section 41 of the Law of Succession Act. He cited the case of In Re Estate of Imoli Luhatse Paul (deceased) [2021] eKLR which, he submitted, restated the pronouncement made in the case of In Re Estate of Florence Mukami Kinyua (deceased) [2018] eKLR, despite the Petitioners being alive to the fact that the Objector is a beneficiary to the same degree of consanguinity, they petitioned the Court without including the Objector, the Objector has annexed a letter from the Chief which confirms that the Objector is a grandchild to the deceased, a family meeting was held after the demise of the deceased where all family members, including the Petitioners, were present and all acknowledged that the Objector had a share in the estate, this was also due to the fact that prior to his death, the deceased had taken care of the Objector and his siblings upon the death of their mother, the actions of the Petitioners of material non-disclosure and concealment of facts are meant to disinherit the Objector which this Court should not condone.
On whether the Objector has met the threshold for revocation of the Grant, Counsel cited the cases of In Re Estate of Prisca Ongayo Nande (deceased) and Albert Inyangala Kisigwa, Succession Cause No. 158 of 2000 and added that under Rule 26 of the Probate and Administration Rules, Letters of Administration should not be granted to any Applicant without notice to every person entitled in the same degree. He then cited the case of In Re estate of Wahome Mwenje Ngonoro (2016) eKLR and added that the Objector was bequeathed 3 acres curved from the property, the Petitioners sold part of the property to a third party (Betra Jemaiyo Cheboi) who is now claiming 5 acres which forms part of the property, the said purchase was done without any legal basis, and that if the Objector is not allowed to claim his rightful share, a great loss will be occasioned as the piece of land is a source of his livelihood.
Petitioners’ Submissions",court,55.76%,model
"Petitioners’ Submissions
On the principles guiding the Court when deciding applications for revocation of a grant, Counsel cited the case of Jamleck Maina Njoroge v Mary Wanjiru Mwangi [2015] eKLR and submitted that at the time of filing the Petition, the Petitioners complied with the requirements, the Chief’s letter listed the beneficiaries and who appended their signatures on Form 38 giving their consent to making of the Grant, the name of the Objector was not listed among the beneficiaries, the gazettement was published on 6/12/2013, there was the statutory 6 months period given to any interested party to raise their objection which the Objector failed to do, the beneficiaries equally appended their signatures on the consent in support of the mode of distribution, the assertions that the Grant was obtained secretly by concealment from Court of the existence of the true beneficiaries and dependents is unfounded, the same was not defective, and that there was no omission of any essential information.
Counsel cited Section 112 of the Evidence Act on burden of proof and also Order 19 Rule 3(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules on the requirement that Affidavits should be confined to such facts as the deponent is able of his own knowledge to prove. He cited the case of Kitale HCCA No. 28 of 2005-Barclays Bank of Kenya Limited v Jeremiah O. Samba t/a Samba & Co. Advocates. He then added that the Application has been made late in the day and is an afterthought, the Objector surrendered his opportunity and should not be given a second bite at the cherry as this would offend the overriding objective which was solely meant to ensure expeditious disposal of business of the Court",court,54.63%,model
"On whether the Objector has the locus standi to file the present Application, Counsel cited the case of Law Society of Kenya vs Commissioner of Lands & Others, High Court Civil Case No. 464 2000 and also Section 2 of the Civil Procedure Rules on the definition of a “legal representative”. He then submitted that there is no evidence whatsoever that the Objector was nominated by the Court or the family he claims to represent to act on their behalf, no death certificate or proof of death of the relationship he claims to have with the deceased has been placed before the Court. He cited the cases of Otieno v Ougo [1986-1989] and Rajesh Pranjvan Chudasama vs Saliesh Pranjivan Chudasama [2014] eKLR. He also cited the case of Julian Adoyo Ogunga & Another v Francis Kiberenge Bondeva, Civil Appeal No. 119 of 2005, in which, he submitted, the Court affirmed Section 54 and 55 of the Law of Succession Act.
Counsel submitted further that litigation must come to an end, the deceased did not leave a Will, the Objector is therefore precluded from raising any claim on basis of the alleged gift, no evidence has been put forth to substantiate the allegation of gift, in terms of priority under Section 29 of the Law of Succession Act, the Petitioners, widows, sons and daughters of the deceased rank higher that the Objector. He cited the case of In Re Estate of M’Muthania Mwendwa (deceased) [2016] and added that the Objector has not demonstrated that he is a dependent, the family members made a provision for the Objector in an alternative parcel of land after a meeting that was held on 25/01/2022, the Objector lacks the locus standi to contest the agreement, the Objector has annexed a letter from the Chief to support his claim, the letter is worthless, a Chief cannot purport to decide the matter.
In conclusion, Counsel submitted that since the Objector seeks to only revoke the Grant, the Application is incompetent, a Grant is merely a form of representation, it does not confer any property to anyone, only a Certificate of Confirmation does, and that revoking the Grant will therefore serve no purpose.
Analysis and Determination",court,56.14%,model
"Analysis and Determination
Although the revocation sought in the Application is only revocation of the Grant, it is clear from the body and nature thereof that the Objector also, by extension, seeks revocation of the confirmed Grant in general. I therefore do not share the Petitioners’ contention that the Application is incompetent.
In the circumstances, upon examination of the Application, the pleadings filed, including the Affidavits and respective parties’ Submissions, I find the issue that arises for determination to be “whether the Grant issued herein and subsequently confirmed should be revoked.
Section 76 of the Law of Succession Act provides as follows:
“Revocation or annulment of grant
A grant of representation, whether or not confirmed, may at any time be revoked or annulled if the court decides, either on application by any Interested Party or of its own motion—
(a) that the proceedings to obtain the grant were defective in substance;
(b) that the grant was obtained fraudulently by the making of a false statement or by the concealment from the court of something material to the case;
(c) that the grant was obtained by means of an untrue allegation of a fact essential in point of law to justify the grant notwithstanding that the allegation was made in ignorance or inadvertently;
(d) that the person to whom the grant was made has failed, after due notice and without reasonable cause either—
(i) to apply for confirmation of the grant within one year from the date thereof, or such longer period as the court order or allow; or
(ii) to proceed diligently with the administration of the estate; or
(iii) to produce to the court, within the time prescribed, any such inventory or account of administration as is required by the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (g) of section 83 or has produced any such inventory or account which is false in any material particular; or
(e) that the grant has become useless and inoperative through subsequent circumstances.”
It is clear that the Objector has come under sub-Sections (a), (b) and (c) cited above.
On the issue of inheritance by grandchildren, my first port of call will be Section 41 of the Law of Succession Act, which provides as follows:
“41. Property devolving upon child to be held in trust",court,56.35%,model
"“41. Property devolving upon child to be held in trust
Where reference is made in this Act to the ""net intestate estate"", or the residue thereof, devolving upon a child or children, the property comprised therein shall be held in trust, in equal shares in the case of more than one child, for all or any of the children of the intestate who attain the age of eighteen years or who, being female, marry under that age, and for all or any of the issue of any child of the intestate who predecease him and who attain that age or so marry, in which case the issue shall take through degrees, in equal shares, the share which their parent would have taken had he not predeceased the intestate.” 
In short therefore, Section 41 provides that where one of the children of the deceased is himself/herself deceased, and such deceased child is survived by a child or children of his/her own, then the share due to him/her ought to devolve upon his/her said child, and where more than one, the children would take equally. 
The question of whether grandchildren can inherit from their grandfather’s estate was addressed in the case of Re Estate of Wahome Njoki Wakagoto (2013) eKLR where it was held as follows:
“Under Part V, grandchildren have no right to inherit their grandparents who die intestate after 1st July 1981. The argument is that such grandchildren should inherit from their own parents. This means that the grandchildren can only inherit their grandparents’ indirectly through their own parents, the children of the deceased. The children inherit first and thereafter grandchildren inherit from the children. The only time grandchildren inherit directly from their grandparents is when the grandchildren’s own parents are dead. The grandchildren step into the shoes of their parents and take directly the share that ought to have gone to the said parents.”
Further, the Court of Appeal in Christine Wangari Gachege v Elizabeth Wanjiru Evans & 11 Others [2014] eKLR held as follows:",court,54.90%,model
"“Although Section 35 and 38 of the Law of Succession Act is silent on the fate of surviving grand children whose parents predeceased the deceased, the rate of substitution of a grandchild for his/her parent in all cases of intestate known as the principle of representation is applicable. The Law is section 41. If a child of the intestate has pre- deceased, the intestate then that child’s issue alive or in centre as mere on that date of the intestate’s death will take in equal shares per stirpes contingent on attaining the age of majority. Per stirpes means that the issue of a deceased child of the intestate take between them the share their parents would have taken had the parent been alive at the intestate’s death”.
On the issue of revocation of Grants, Section 76 was expounded upon by Hon. Justice W. Musyoka in the case of Re Estate of Prisca Ong’ayo Nande (Deceased) [2020] eKLR where he stated as follows:",court,55.43%,model
"“Under section 76, a court may revoke a grant so long as the grounds listed above are disclosed, either on its own motion or on the application of a party. A grant of letters of administration may be revoked on three general grounds. The first is where the process of obtaining the grant was attended by problems. The first would be where the process was defective, either because some mandatory procedural step was omitted, or the persons applying for representation was not competent or suitable for appointment, or the deceased died testate having made a valid will and then a grant or letters of administration intestate was made instead of a grant of probate, or vice versa. It could also be that the process was marred by fraud and misrepresentation or concealment of matter, such as where some survivors are not disclosed or the Applicant lies that he is a survivor when he is not, among other reasons. The second general ground is where the grant was obtained procedurally, but the administrator, thereafter, got into problems with the exercise of administration, such as where he fails to apply for confirmation of grant within the time allowed, or he fails to proceed diligently with administration, or fails to render accounts as and when required. The third general ground is where the grant has become useless and inoperative following subsequent circumstances, such as where a sole administrator dies leaving behind no administrator to carry on the exercise, or where the sole administrator loses the soundness of his mind for whatever reason or even becomes physically infirm to an extent of being unable to carry out his duties as administrator, or the sole administrator is adjudged bankrupt and, therefore, becomes unqualified to hold any office of trust.”
The Petitioners’ Counsel has challenged the Application on the ground that not being a legal representative of the estate of her deceased mother, the Objector lacks the locus standi to bring the present Application. I am aware of several authorities which advance the principle that a grandchild can only claim the share in his/her grandparent’s estate if he/she holds a grant of representation over his own late parent’s estate. I am aware for instance, to the case of Cleopa Amutala Namayi vs. Judith Were Succession Cause 457 of 2005 [2015] eKLR where Mrima, J observed as follows:",court,55.04%,model
"“Be that as it may, under Part V of the Act grandchildren have no automatic right to inherit their grandparents (sic) who died intestate after 01/07/1981 when the Act came into operation. The argument behind this position is that such grandchildren should inherit from their own parents. This means that the grandchildren can only inherit their grandparents (sic) indirectly through their own parents, the children of their grandparents. The children to the grandparents inherit first and thereafter the grandchildren inherit from their parents. The only time where the grandchildren can inherit directly from their grandparents is when the grandchildren’s own parents are dead. Those grandchildren can now step into the shoes of their parents and take directly the share that ought to have gone to the said parents. Needless to say, such grandchildren must hold appropriate representation on behalf of their parents.” (emphasis mine)
In my view, having described himself as a grandson of the deceased and having alleged that, before his demise, the deceased was taking care of him since his childhood, and having also alleged that the deceased is the one who put him on occupation of the 3 acres of the land, I find that the Objector’s pleadings disclose a legally recognized interest, at least as a dependent, even if not as a beneficiary. None of these claims is dependent on one being a legal representative and, in any case, nowhere has the Objector stated that he is making the claim for or on behalf of the estate of her mother. The only burden that the Objector must discharge is to prove his said allegations made in his Application.
On this view, I find company in the decision of H.K. Chemitei J in In re Estate of Hellen Wangari Wathiai (Deceased) [2021] eKLR in which, in declining to shut out a grandchild from claiming a share in his grandfather’s estate on the alleged ground of not holding a grant of representation over his parent’s estate, stated as follows:",court,54.80%,model
"“52. The evidence on record suggest that the Applicant herein brought these proceedings on behalf of his father; Abdi Ibrahim Hassan (deceased) who was the beneficiary to his father’s estate. The Applicant’s interest emanates from the fact that his father was a beneficiary to the suit property, thus the Applicant being dependent to his father Abdi Ibrahim Ibrahim’s estate within the provisions of Section 29 of the Law of succession Act, he acquires an interest in his grandfather’s estate; the suit property by virtue of his father’s share. Therefore, in the court’s view, the instant Application is properly before this court.
53. In my humble view, therefore, it is clear that the applicant had the locus standi and he was rightfully before the court to fight for the interests of the estate of his late father with regard to the deceased grandmother’s estate. The fact that he was a grandchild of the deceased taken care of by his deceased grandmother prior to her death and a dependant of his father’s estate has not been disputed.
54. This therefore supports the fact that he and his sister acquired interest over the deceased’s grandmother’s estate and thus he had the necessary locus standi. ….”
There is also the case of In re Estate of Imoli Luhatse Paul (Deceased) [2021] eKLR, where Musyoka J stated as follows:",court,56.68%,model
"“3. In the instant case, the applicant, in the summons for revocation of grant, is a child of a dead son of the deceased herein. The applicant is claiming directly by dint of In re Estate of Veronica Njoki Wakagoto (Deceased) [2013] eKLR (Musyoka J) and In re Estate of Florence Mukami Kinyua (Deceased) [2018] eKLR (T. Matheka J), and does not require to take out letters of administration to intervene in the estate of her late grandfather, where her own parents are dead. Secondly, apart from case law, the provisions of the Law of Succession Act cover these situations. Section 39 of the Law of Succession Act makes grandchildren heirs in intestacy, where their own parents, who are biological children of the deceased, are dead. Section 41 of the Law of Succession Act is the provision that enables grandchildren to step into the shoes, of their own parents, and to step into those shoes they need not take out letters of administration.”
Turning to the merits of this matter, I have carefully perused the Petitioners’ Replying Affidavit and established that they have not denied, and even to some extent have confirmed, that the Objector is a grandson of the deceased, that the Objector’s late mother is a daughter of the deceased, that the Petitioners are therefore the Objector’s uncles, that the Objector’s mother never got married but gave birth to 3 children (2 daughters and the Objector), that the 3 children, including the Objector, grew up in the home of the deceased, that the deceased is the one who took care of the children and brought them up since childhood, that it is the deceased who put the Objector into occupation of the 3 acres portion of the property L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/(Segoit Rock/2) and that the Objector even built his homestead thereon.",court,56.17%,model
"Although in his Submissions, Counsel for the Petitioners has sought to contest or contradict some of the above facts and also raised some new factual matters, he cannot do so at this stage. Any denial, challenge or contestation of facts or introduction of new facts could only have been validly done by the Petitioners in their Replying Affidavit, not in the subsequent Submissions by Counsel. I therefore take the above facts stated by the Objector as reflecting the correct and true position.
Flowing from the above, I find that the Objector’s late mother having been a daughter of the deceased, just like the Petitioners, she too was entitled to a share of the estate of the deceased and was therefore a “beneficiary”. However, having died before distribution and having left behind children, such children therefore “stepped into her shoes” and are entitled to claim their mother’s share. However, since amongst the 3 children, only the Objector has approached this Court, I will only deal with his claim.
Further, having been brought up in the in the home of the deceased, having been put into occupation by the deceased and having built his homestead within the property as L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/(Segoit Rock/2) without evidence of any protest from the Petitioners or anyone else, I find that the Objector, apart from having the right to claim her mother’s share, is also a “dependent” of the estate. He was therefore entitled to be included in the whole process of Succession and his consent sought. 
However, not being a direct beneficiary as a son or daughter of the deceased, it may not be fair to accuse the Petitioners of deliberate concealment of facts or fraud. 
Regarding the family meeting alleged by the Objector to have been held on 11/01/2022 and whose minutes the Objector has exhibited, the Petitioners have not denied that it took place and that the minutes are authentic. A perusal of the minutes reveals that it was agreed as follows:
“(1) Mr. Mathew Kiptoo to continue to stay at his farm (house)”",court,54.76%,model
"In the absence of denial and/or evidence to the contrary, although the Objector may not have established fraud or defect in substance to warrant revocation of the Grant under Section 76 of the Law of Succession Act, I find that he has established a case to justify rectification of the Certificate of Confirmation to provide for his share. 
Final orders 
In the premises, the Summons dated 11/04/2022 filed by the Objector partially succeeds in the following terms: 
A declaration is hereby made that the Objector is entitled to retain, occupy and/or possess the 3 acres that he has at all material times been occupying within the property known as L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/(Segoit Rock/2).
Consequently, the property L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/(Segoit Rock/2), being 12.79 hectares, the remaining 9.79 hectares is what will now be available for distribution amongst the initial 6 beneficiaries listed in the Certificate of Confirmation given on 29/11/2021.
To factor in the 3 acres now awarded to the Objector out of the property L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/(Segoit Rock/2), the 6 beneficiaries who initially shared out the property as per the Certificate of Confirmation given on 29/11/2021 shall each cede an equal proportion of acreage to make up a total of the 3 acres now awarded to the Objector.
The parties are at liberty to discuss, negotiate or agree on any other alternative mode of distribution to achieve the declaration made in (i) above and accordingly move the Court to adopt it. Until then, order (iii) above shall remain in place.
To give the parties time to discuss, negotiate or agree on an alternative formula for achieving order (i) above, the Rectified or Amended Certificate of Confirmation of Grant shall only be liable to be signed and issued by this Court after lapse of ninety (90) days from the date hereof.",court,52.83%,model
"During such ninety (90) days referred to above, there shall be no sale, transfer, subdivision or conveyance of any kind over the said property L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/(Segoit Rock/2), and the Objector’s occupation and possession of the 3 acres portion thereof as awarded to the Objector hereinabove shall not be interfered with by any person in any manner.
Regarding one Betra Jemaiyo Cheboi who has been alleged to have purchased 5 acres portion of the said property L.R. No. Sergoit Koiwop Tao Block 7/(Segoit Rock/2), if at all she did so purchase, then she will be at liberty to seek a refund for the proportionate acreage that will now be reduced from the portion that she purchased, from the person who sold the same to her.

RULING
The Application herein seeks Review of orders earlier given in this Cause on 7/11/2019.
The background of the matter is that the deceased, Benson Mbatiah Muya died on 22/10/2010 at the age of 83 years. He left behind a widow, Sarah Wanjiku Mbatiah and 4 children, namely, Reuben Kamanu Mbatiah, Johnson Kahira Mbatia (1st Respondent), Elly Kuria Mbatiah (Applicant) and Charles Wanyoike Mbatiah (2nd Respondent). The deceased also left behind a number of parcels of land.
On 27/03/2006, the widow, Sarah Wanjiku Mbatia applied for Grant of Letters of Administration Intestate in respect of the estate. Such Grant was then issued by the Court on 16/08/2006, was subsequently confirmed on 16/03/2009 and the estate distributed. 
However, on 23/03/2009, the present 2nd Respondent, Charles Wanyoike Mbatiah applied for revocation of the grant claiming that he was never consulted and that the Grant was obtained fraudently. He also challenged the mode of distribution adopted. In the intervening period and before the Application could be heard, the widow-sole Administrator died in March 2013, thus rendering the Grant inoperative.",court,55.76%,model
"Pursuant to confirmation of the Grant, one of the parcels of land, Uasin Gishu/Kimumu/2373 vested to the joint ownership of the Applicant and the 1st Respondent, Elly Kuria Mbatiah and Johnson Kahira Mbatia, respectively. The duo then transferred the parcel into their name and subsequently, sometime in the year 2015, sold the same at a purchase price of Kshs 8,000,000/- to the interested party, Elizabeth Jepchumba Tunoi who in turn, obtained a title in her name.
Pursuant to an Application filed by the 2nd Respondent on 19/08/2015, the Court (S.M. Githinji J) on 7/11/2019 ordered that the said property, Uasin Gishu/Kimumu/2377, do revert to the estate and also that the Applicant and the 1st Respondent, Elly Kuria Mbatiah and Johnson Kahira Mbatia, respectively, do, inter alia, deposit the purchase price in a joint interest earning account. Upon failure by the duo to comply with the order to deposit the purchase price, a Notice was issued to them on 15/01/2020, to show cause why they should not be committed to civil jail.
In response, by the Application dated 6/02/2020 the duo sought leave to appeal out of time against the decision and for such leave to operate as a stay of all proceedings in the Cause. The Application was dismissed on 30/11/2020.

"Hearing of the Application 
The Application was canvassed by way of written Submissions. Pursuant to directions given, the Applicant filed his Submissions on 8/12/2021 while the 2nd Respondent filed on 21/06/2022.
Applicant’s Submissions
Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the 2nd Respondent filed the Summons dated 19/08/2015 seeking among others, orders that the Applicant be restrained from carrying on any dealings in respect of the assets (parcels of land) of the deceased, that the said assets/plots revert or be restored to the estate, that the Applicant do account to the estate and its beneficiaries for the proceeds arising from the sale of the parcel of land Uasin Gishu Kimumu/2373 and deposit the proceeds in Court or in an interest earning account and that the Grant of Letters of Administration made to one Serah Wanjiku Mbatiah on 16/08/2006 and confirmed on 13/02/2009 be revoked or annulled.
Counsel submitted further that the Application proceeded ex pate without the participation of the Applicant and Ruling was delivered on 7/11/2019, the Court granted all the prayers sought, after receiving a copy of the Ruling and Notice to Show Cause, the Applicant filed an Application seeking leave to appeal but the same was dismissed and that subsequently, by the orders made by the Deputy Registrar, the Applicant was granted 60 days to comply. 
Counsel added that the amount to be deposited being Kshs 8,000,000/- for the Applicant and the 2nd Respondent, it technically means that the Applicant is supposed to deposit Kshs 4,000,000/-, the value of the property which the Applicant seeks to deposit in substitution is Kshs 7,500,000/-, the money ordered to be deposited belongs to the estate, after distribution of the estate, this amount will be taken into account and therefore the 2nd Respondent will not be prejudiced in any way and that the Applicant has been unable to raise the funds and/or get a buyer for the property.",court,55.50%,model
"Regarding the 2nd Respondent’s contention that the Motion offends Rule 49 of the Probate and Administration Rules, Counsel argued that Article 51 and 21 of the Constitution requires the Courts to administer justice without undue regard to procedural technicalities. On the allegation of delay to file the Application, Counsel responded that the Court did not order any timelines for depositing the money and cited the case of Estate of Omur Abdalla Taib [2017] eKLR.
2nd Respondent’s Submissions
Counsel for the 2nd Respondent submitted that Order 45(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules demands that any Application seeking review of a Judgment or Order must be made without unreasonable delay, the Application has not been brought without unreasonable delay, no reason for the delay of over 2 years has been advanced, the Motion is an afterthought and has been brought as a reaction to the consequences of committal to civil jail. He cited the cases of Godfrey Wanjala Wafula & Another v Jairus Wakhungu Mulunda [2020] eKLR.
Regarding the prayer that the Applicant do substitute the order by depositing a title deed instead of the amount of Kshs 8,000,000/-, Counsel submitted that the issue has already been litigated upon, that on 24/09/2021 the Applicant made the same prayer before the Deputy Registrar who declined it and directed that failure to deposit the amount will warrant committal to civil jail. He added that the Court is now functus officio and cited the case of Election Petitions No. 3, 4 & 5, Raila Odinga & Others vs. IEBC & Others [2013] eKLR cited with approval in the article by Daniel Malan Pretorius. He also cited the case of Jersey Evening Post Limited v Al Thani [2002] JLR 542.
Counsel submitted further that bearing in mind that the Court had already denied the same prayer, it would be prudent for the Applicant to now sell the land parcel whose title he wishes to deposit as security and deposit the proceeds as ordered by the Court.",court,57.09%,model
"In conclusion, he added that if the Applicant was aggrieved by the decision of the Court, then he ought to have appealed, as opposed to seeking a Review. He cited the case of Abasi Belinda v Fredrick Kangwamu & Another [1963] E.A. 557.
Analysis and Determination
Upon examination of the Pleadings, Affidavits, Submissions and the entire Record, I find the issue that arises for determination in this Application to be “whether the orders given herein on 7/11/2019 should be reviewed”.
Review of orders in a Succession Cause is governed by Rule 63(1) of the Probate and Administration Rules, which provides as follows: 
“63. Application of Civil Procedure Rules and High Court (Practice and Procedure) Rules
(1) Save as is in the Act or in these Rules otherwise provided, and subject to any order of the court or a registrar in any particular case for reasons to be recorded, the following provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules, namely Orders V, X, XI, XV, XVIII, XXV, XLIV and XLIX (Cap. 21, Sub. Leg.), together with the High Court (Practice and Procedure) Rules (Cap. 8, Sub. Leg.), shall apply so far as relevant to proceedings under these Rules.
It is therefore clear from the foregoing that the only provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules imported to the Law of Succession Act are those listed above and which includes Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules which relates to Review (see John Mundia Njoroge & 9 Others vs. Cecilia Muthoni Njoroge & Another [2016] eKLR).
In the circumstances, any party seeking review of orders in a probate or Succession matter, must meet the requirements set under Order 45(1). The same provides as follows:
“1. (1) Any person considering himself aggrieved—
(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or
(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed,",court,56.13%,model
"(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed,
and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.
It is therefore clear that Order 45 provides for three circumstances under which an order for review can be made. The first one is that the Applicant must demonstrate that there has been discovery of new and important matter or evidence. The second is where there has been a mistake or error apparent on the face of the record. The third ground is as “for any other sufficient reason”.
The Applicant has not disclosed the ground under which he has approached the Court but clearly it is not on account of “discovery of new evidence” nor “mistake or error”. It can only therefore presumably be the third ground, namely, “for any other sufficient reason”.
Counsel for the 2nd Respondent submitted that Order 45(1) demands that any Application seeking a review of an Order must be made without unreasonable delay. He argued that having been filed more than 2 years after the order sought to be reviewed was given, the Application was filed after an unreasonable delay. 
It is true that the impugned Ruling was made on 7/09/2019. It is also true that the present Application seeking review of the said order was filed on 18/09/2021. Clearly this was in excess of 2 years. Without any explanation over this time lapse, I find that indeed, the Application was filed after an inordinate and unreasonable delay thus breaching the requirement stipulated under Order 45(1) above.
It is also true that after the impugned order was given on 7/11/2019, the Applicant filed the Application dated 6/02/2020 seeking leave to appeal out of time. The Application was dismissed on 30/11/2020. In his Ruling, S. Githinji J stated as follows
“Whether the application has been made without unreasonable delay",court,57.20%,model
"“Whether the application has been made without unreasonable delay
The ruling was delivered on 7th November 2019. The application was made on 6th February 2020, close to three months after. They have attributed the delay to the fact that they were unrepresented as their advocate had ceased acting and thus they were unaware of the orders. A perusal of the ruling indicates that there was no advocate for the respondent on the day of the ruling.
In re Estate of Margaret Njambi Thuo (Deceased) [2020] eKLR the court held as follows on unreasonable delay;
The applicant has not bothered to explain the delay of two months. What is considered as unreasonable delay will vary from case to case. In Jaber Mohsen Ali’s case, the court said as follows:
“The question that arises is whether this application has been filed after unreasonable delay. What is unreasonable delay is dependent on the surrounding circumstances of each case. Even one day after Judgment could be unreasonable delay depending on the Judgment of the court and any order given thereafter.” The Judge went ahead to state that ……. “In the case of Christopher Kendagor v Christopher Kipkorir, Eldoret ELC No.919 of 2012 the applicant had been given 14 days to vacate the suit land. He filed an application one day after the 14 days. The application was denied. The court holding that, the application ought to have come before expiry of the period given to vacate the land.”
I find that three months is too long a period to not have followed up on the matter. Further, their advocates while filing an application to cease acting touted the fact that the applicants were not picking their calls or communicating with them. In the premises I find that the delay was unreasonable. The litigants were clearly dragging their feet and ignoring the matter.”
On the same subject of depositing the purchase price therefore, the Applicant has already been found to have been guilty of unreasonable delay to approach Court for Review. In his Ruling, Githinji J found that the delay of 3 months was unreasonable. In the present Application, that delay of 3 months has since escalated to over 2 years. If 3 months was already found in this very matter and subject to have been inordinate, how can this Court now contradict that earlier finding and declare a delay of over 2 years to be reasonable?",court,55.53%,model
"The Applicant has not at all addressed or given any reasons for the delay in filing the Application for review. In the absence of any explanation, I find that the delay is gross and unreasonable.
The 2nd Respondent has also correctly submitted that, in any event, the prayer that the Applicant be allowed, in substitution, to deposit a title deed instead of the amount of Kshs 8,000,000/-, had already been litigated upon before the Deputy Registrar. I agree with this Submission since the record shows that indeed, the same prayer was placed before the Deputy Registrar when the Notice to show cause came before her. The Deputy Registrar delivered a reasoned Ruling on 24/09/2021 whereof she declined the prayer and granted the Applicant a period of 60 days to deposit the funds as ordered by Githinji J.
The said directions by the Deputy Registrar not having been challenged, and this Court not having been moved to set aside the same, the directions remain a valid and lawful order upon which this Court has no reason to interfere.
Final orders 
In the premises, the Notice of Motion dated 16/11/2021 filed by the Applicant, the said Elly Kuria Mbatiah is hereby dismissed with costs to the 2nd Respondent, the said Charles Wanyoike Mbatiah.

BETWEEN
NGUI KATUVI ………………..…………………………………..………………... 1ST APPELLANT

AND
JOHN WAKIRI KIRE ………………………………………………………………... RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal from the Ruling and Order of Hon. K. O. Gweno, Adjudicator/RM dated 23rd March 2022 at Milimani Small Claims Court Case No. E530 of 2021) 
JUDGMENT
The appeal herein emanates from a ruling by the Small Claims Court declining to set aside an ex-parte judgment entered against the Appellants. 
By the judgment dated 17.12.2021 (“the Judgment”), the Small Claims court found the Appellants fully liable for a road traffic accident that took place on 16.06.2021. The Respondent suffered injuries as a result of the accident and was awarded an aggregate sum of Kshs. 450,000.00 comprising general damages, special damages and lost earnings. 
Execution of the decree by the Respondent caused the Appellants to lodge an application dated 04.02.2022 seeking to set aside interlocutory judgment entered against it. In his supporting affidavit, the Respondent stated that he came to learn of the Judgment as a result of the execution. He requested to cross-examine the deponent of the process server regarding the mode of service and that they be allowed to file the Response to the Statement of Claim as their defence raises triable issues.
In his response to the application, the Respondent’s advocate opposed the application on the ground that that the judgment was regular and no basis had been made to set aside the Judgment as the Appellants advocates had been notified of the proceedings and despite being served they failed to participate in the proceedings.",court,57.04%,model
"The Adjudicator considered the application and held that since the Appellants had not contested service, the Judgment was regular. That the Appellants did not give any reasons why they did not file their defence on time and the court declined to exercise discretion in their favour.
As this is an Appeal from the Small Claims Court, the jurisdiction of the Court is circumscribed by section 38 of the Small Claims Court Act (“the SCCA”) which limits appeals to matters of law. This means the Court can only intervene if the evidence on record does not reasonably support the conclusions made by the trial Court.
Under section 43 of the SCCA, the court may on application of any party to the proceedings set aside any of its orders and make such orders as it thinks just. This jurisdiction, as with the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to set aside default judgment is wide and unfettered and the appellate court will not interfere with the decision of the trial court unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his discretion has misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision, or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been an injustice (see Mbogo v Shah [1968] EA 93 and United India Insurance Co. Ltd and Others v East African Underwriters (Kenya) Ltd NRB CA Civil Appeal No. 36 of 1983 [1985] eKLR).
From the record, the default judgment was entered on 11.11.2021 by the Adjudicator who was satisfied the Respondents were duly served. Thereafter the court fixed the matter for formal proof on 21.11.2021 on which day it proceeded for formal proof and judgment was duly reserved. 
While the Appellants refute service of the Statement of Claim, in ground (c) of the application dated 04.02.2022, they state as follows:",court,57.89%,model
"The Respondents/Applicants had instructed the firm of Kimondo Gachoka & Company Advocates to come on record on their behalf  and the said firm (filed its) Memorandum of Appearance and Response to the Statement of Claim dated 2nd December 2021 and served upon the firm on record for the Claimant/Respondent on 8th December, 2021 and further wrote various letter(s) dated 26th November 2021 and 30th December 2021 which were received by the firm but no disclosure was made to the firm of Kimondo & Gachoka and Co. Advocates that there was an interlocutory judgment against their client or that the matter was coming up for hearing mention or judgment.
This statement was confirmed by the Respondent hence the Adjudicator was correct to come to the conclusion that in fact Appellants were duly served hence the interlocutory judgment was regular. Further by the time the Appellants purportedly entered appearance and filed their Response to the Claim on 02.12.2021, interlocutory judgment had been entered, the formal proof had proceeded and the judgment reserved for 17.12.2021. I use the word purported because the entry of interlocutory judgment debarred the Appellants from filing their Response to the Claim unless that interlocutory judgment was set aside. 
Even where the judgment is regular, the court may yet proceed to set aside the judgment if justice of the case demands, particularly where the defendant demonstrates that it has a good defence and any prejudice caused by setting aside may be assuaged by an award of costs (see Tree Shade Motors Limited v D T Dobie and Company (K) Ltd and Another [1998] eKLR).",court,56.29%,model
"While the Appellants did not explain why they failed to file their Response to the Claim within the time prescribed, the Adjudicator did not consider whether the Appellants had a good defence or whether indeed any prejudice could be assuaged by an order for costs. In this case, it is clear that by purporting to file memorandum of appearance and the Response to the Claim the Appellants demonstrated an intention to defend the claim. As to whether the Appellants’ response raised a triable issue, is clear that the Respondent was a pedestrian and thus the issue of whether the Appellants were fully liable or whether the Respondent contributed to the accident was a live issue. I also hold that this is a case where costs and a conditional order would sufficiently protect the Respondent.
Having reached the aforesaid conclusion, I allow the appeal and order as follows:
The interlocutory judgment entered against the Appellants on 11.11.2021 and the judgment of 17.12.2021 is set aside on the terms hereunder.
The Appellants shall deposit the decretal amount in a joint interest earning account in the names of the Advocates of the Appellants and the Respondent within 21 days from the date hereof.
The Appellants shall pay costs of the proceeding in the Subordinate Court and of this Appeal assessed at Kshs. 35,000.00 within 21 days from the date hereof.
The Response to the Claim filed in the Small Claims Court shall be deemed as duly filed and served.
The matter is referred back to the Small Claims Court for disposal.

CIVIL APPEAL NO.     E040    OF 2021
JIANGXI KHONGMEI ENG. COMPANY LTD--------------APPELLANT

ELIUD WAFULA MAELO----------------------------------------RESPONDENT
(Being an appeal arising from the Ruling by Hon. G.P. OMONDI (S.R.M) in Bungoma Civil Suit no. 276 of 2018 delivered on 30th April,2020).
JUDGEMENT
Vide a plaint dated 30th May,2018 the Respondent sued the Appellant and another seeking for payment of Kshs.120,000/= w.e.f 1st December 2016 until full payment plus costs and interest. The Appellant filed a defence dated 23rd July 2018 and the Respondent in turn filed a response to the defence dated 1st October,2018.
Parties thereafter complied with Order 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules paving way for the matter being set down for hearing. On the 1st hearing date, the Appellant’s counsel sought for an adjournment which was allowed with costs to the Respondent and that the matter was fixed for hearing on 2nd July, 2019 by consent. Come 2nd July, 2019, the Appellant did not appear and the matter proceeded ex-parte with the Respondent calling two witnesses and thereafter closing his case. The Appellants case was subsequently closed for non-attendance and directions on filing submissions were taken for 16th July,2019 and- thereafter judgment was subsequently delivered on 16th October,2019.
The Respondent drew his bill of costs dated 31st October,2019 and served the Appellant who did not oppose the same and that the Court subsequently taxed it at Kshs. 513,765/=. The Respondent immediately commenced execution and instructed a firm of Auctioneers namely Eshikhoni Auctioneers who attached the appellant’s assets to realize the sums owed by the Appellant as well as their costs.",court,55.02%,model
"The Appellant filed an application dated 9th December,2019 seeking orders inter alia for stay of the courts decree restraining the firm of auctioneers from seizing proclaimed property and for the setting aside of the judgment delivered on 16th October, 2019.The court issued interim orders which were vacated on 30th April,2020 when the court dismissed the application with costs to the Respondent. At the same time, the auctioneers bill of costs dated 13th December,2019 was allowed as presented as the Appellant did not register its opposition. 
The Appellants filed yet another application dated 19th June,2020 seeking for orders inter alia; stay of execution of the judgment delivered on 16th October, 2019 and for release of the attached motor vehicle. Interim orders were granted and a hearing date issued. On the hearing date, the trial Court was informed that a similar application had been filed in the High Court and that the decretal sum had been deposited in a joint interest earning account and thus the application was deemed as spent. Various other applications were filed in this court all which have already been dealt with leaving behind for determination the appeal dated 2nd July,2021 challenging the court’s ruling dated 30th April 2020 on the application dated 9th December,2020.
The Appellant lodged its Memorandum of Appeal dated 2nd July,2021, on the following grounds:
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in treating the application and submissions before him superficially and consequently coming to a wrong conclusion on the same.
The learned trial magistrate failed to exercise discretion judiciously when he disallowed the application seeking to set aside ex-parte proceedings and judgment where the court had condemned the Appellant to pay Kshs. 3,896,715/= plus interest and costs yet the case had not been heard and determined on its merits.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to appreciate that the Appellant’s then advocates M/S Kidiavai & Company Advocates had without care and out of negligence failed to attend- court when the matter was coming up for hearing and communicate his in ability to reach the Appellant and adjourn the matter to another date.",court,57.13%,model
"The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the pleadings filed and authorities submitted on behalf of the appellant and further taking into account evidence that was not supported by the pleadings before court and thus arriving at an award that is so manifestly high so as to be erroneous.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to appreciate that the failure by the Appellant to attend court due to communication breakdown between it and their advocates was an excusable mistake visited upon the Appellant buy it advocates.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in not appreciating sufficiently or at all the pleadings and evidence that was on record as a whole.
The learned trial magistrate failed to exercise discretion judiciously when justice for the case mandates that the mistakes of an advocate even if they were blunders, should not be visited on the clients when the situation can be remedied by costs.
The learned trial magistrate in rendering his ruling dismissing the application to set aside ex-parte judgment and proceedings failed to take into account the principle of proportionality, and did not do justice to the appellant whose advocates failed to attend court and was condemned to pay Kshs.3,896,715/= plus interest and costs.
The Appellant prayed for the appeal to be allowed and the ruling in question be set aside and in its place the Appellant be allowed to defend the suit in the subordinate court or in the alternative the award for general damages in the subordinate court be reduced in line with the vehicle hire agreement as produced in the lower court and/or as this Honourable court deems fit and just.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. The Appellant and the Respondent filed and exchanged their respective submissions.",court,56.09%,model
"Vide submissions dated 27th June 2023 and filed on 29th June,2023, the Appellant submitted that the impugned ruling offended the interest of justice. It was their submission that the failure to attend court for defence hearing was neither deliberate nor intentional but due to communication breakdown between the appellant and their advocate on record. Counsel quoted the case of Mbogoh & Another vs. Shah (1968)EA 93 and James  Kanyiita Nderitu & Another  vs. Marios Philotas Ghiksa & Another (2016) eKLR. The Appellant further relied on Article 159 (2) of the Constitution Section 1A and 1B of the Civil Procedure Act and stated that it filed an arguable defence denying the Respondents claim and that it was only fair that they be allowed to prosecute their case and by so doing the Respondent would not be prejudiced in any way
It was further submitted that the sum involved was colossal and that the Appellant was disputing the car hire agreement informing the Respondents claim. Counsel quoted the case of Patel vs. EA Handling Services Limited (1974) EZ 75 and Tree Shade Motor Ltd vs, DT Dobie Co. Ltd CA 38 of 1998 and Maina vs. Muriuki (1984)KLR 407. The Appellant submitted that the court should not condemn the Appellant unheard and that they ought not to suffer due to a mistake by its counsel and quoted the case of Lee G Muthonga vs. Habib Zurich Finance (K) Limited & Another in Civil Application no. Nair 236 of 2009 and Winnie Wambui Kibinge & 2others vs. Match Electrical Limited Civil Case No. 222 of 2010. It was further submitted that the Appellant’s defence raised triable issues and that the Respondent can be compensated by way of costs and that the decretal sum had been deposited in a joint account. Lastly, the Appellant submitted that that the Respondent himself had filed an application to appeal out of time meaning that he was also dissatisfied with the lower court’s judgment and the Court should therefore allow this appeal and set aside the lower court’s judgment",court,55.26%,model
"The Respondent’s submissions are dated 20th September,2023 and filed on 22nd September,2023. He submitted that the Court judiciously exercised its discretion and disallowed the Appellants application subject of this application. It was his submission that the Appellant’s argument in the application was not justifiable thus unworthy of the orders sought and that the trial Court cannot therefore be faulted. Counsel quoted the case in Civil Appeal 36 of 1983 United India Insurance Co. Limited & Others vs. East Africa Underwrites (Kenya) Limited (1985) Eklr. It was submitted that the argument that the Respondent sough to appeal the trial courts findings was not reason enough to allow the Appellants appeal. Lastly, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant did not develop the argument for reduction of the decretal sum as prayed in the appeal and he therefore urged the court to dismiss the Appeal with costs.
This being a first appeal, parties are entitled to and expect a rehearing, reevaluation and reconsideration of the evidence afresh and a determination of this court with reasons for such determination. In other words, a first appeal is by way of retrial and this court, as the first appellate court, has a duty to re-evaluate, re-analyze and re-consider the evidence and draw its own conclusions, of course bearing in mind that it did not see the witnesses testifying and therefore give due allowance for that.
In Gitobu Imanyara & 2 others v Attorney General [2016] e KLR, the Court of Appeal stated that;
“[A]n appeal to this Court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this Court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put, they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowances in this respect”
In Peters v Sunday Post Ltd [1958] EA 424, the Court held that;",court,56.45%,model
"In Peters v Sunday Post Ltd [1958] EA 424, the Court held that;
“Whilst an appellate court has jurisdiction to review the evidence to determine whether the conclusions of the trial judge should stand, this jurisdiction is exercised with caution; if there is no evidence to support a particular conclusion, or if it is shown that the trial judge has failed to appreciate the weight or bearing of circumstances admitted or proved, or had plainly gone wrong, the appellate court will not hesitate so to decide”
Similarly, in Abok James Odera t/a A.J Odera & Associates v John Patrick Machira t/a Machira & Co. Advocates [2013] e KLR, the same stated with regard to the duty of the first appellate court;
“This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and reanalyze the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial Judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way”
I have given due consideration to the appeal herein, the evidence before the trial Court, the grounds of appeal and the submissions by the parties in this appeal as well as the parties’ submissions in the lower Court. In my humble view, I find the issues for consideration is whether the appeal has merit and what is the appropriate order for costs.
That the decision whether or not to set aside ex parte judgement is discretionary is not in doubt and that the discretion is intended so to be exercised to avoid injustice and hardship resulting from accident, inadvertence or excusable mistake or error, but is not designed to assist a person who has deliberately sought whether by evasion or otherwise to obstruct or delay the course of justice. See Shah vs. Mbogo & Another [1967] EA 116.
In this case, the grounds upon which the application to set aside the judgement was made were two-fold.  First, it was contended that there was a miscommunication between the Appellant and their advocate on record on the stages of proceedings before the trial court and secondly as a result, they were denied an opportunity to defend their case.
As was held by the Court of Appeal in CMC Holdings Ltd vs. Nzioki [2004] KLR 173:",court,56.50%,model
"“In an application for setting aside ex parte judgement, the Court exercises its discretion in allowing or rejecting the same. That discretion must be exercised upon reasons and must be exercised judiciously…In law the discretion that a court of law has, in deciding whether or not to set aside ex parte order was meant to ensure that a litigant does not suffer injustice or hardship as a result of amongst other an excusable mistake or error. It would not be proper use of such discretion if the Court turns its back to a litigant who clearly demonstrates such an excusable mistake, inadvertence, accident or error. Such an exercise of discretion would be wrong principle. In the instant case the learned trial magistrate did not exercise her discretion properly when she failed to address herself as to whether the appellant’s unchallenged allegation that its counsel did not inform it of the hearing date for the hearing that took place ex parte and hence it would appear was true and not if true, the effect of the same on the ex parte judgement was entered as a result of the non-appearance of the appellant and on the entire suit. The answer to that weighty matter was not to advise the appellant of the recourse open to it as the learned magistrate did here. In doing so she drove the appellant out of the seat of justice empty handed when it had what it might have well amounted to an excusable mistake visited upon the appellant by its advocate...The second disturbing matter which arises from the decision of the learned magistrate in dismissing the application for setting aside the ex parte judgement is that in so dismissing the same application, the learned trial magistrate does not appear to have considered whether or not the defence which was already on record was reasonable or raised triable issues. The law is now well settled that in an application for setting aside ex parte judgement, the Court must consider not only the reasons why the defence was not filed or for that matter why the applicant failed to turn up for the hearing on the hearing date but also whether the applicant has reasonable defence which is usually referred as whether the defence if filed already or if draft defence is annexed to the application, raises triable issues. The Court has wide discretion in such cases to set aside ex parte judgement. In the instant case, the defence and counterclaim was already in the file when the matter was heard ex parte and the trial magistrate stated that she considered the same and dismissed the same defence and counterclaim when the appellant was not in court to put forward its",court,57.02%,model
"same and dismissed the same defence and counterclaim when the appellant was not in court to put forward its case. Further it appears that certain matters raised in the defence were not considered at all and indeed could not be considered without the appellant’s input..... What the Trial Court should have done when hearing the application to set aside the ex parte judgement was to ignore her judgement on record and look at the matter afresh considering the pleadings before her and see if on their face value a prima facie triable issue (even if only one) was raised by the defence and counterclaim. If the same was raised, then whether the reasons for the appellant’s appearance were weak, she was in law bound to exercise her discretion and set aside the ex parte judgement so as to allow the appellant to put forward its defence. Of course in such a case, the applicant would be condemned in costs or even ordered to pay thrown away costs. The learned judge should not have considered what the learned Trial Court had concluded on the evidence before her but should have in the same way looked at the pleading and considered whether a triable issue was raised by the defence and if so, then the appeal should have been allowed.”",court,56.98%,model
"In Pindoria Construction Ltd vs. Ironmongers Sanytaryware Civil Appeal No. 16 of 1976 it was held that:
“It is a common ground that it is a matter for discretion whether or not to set aside a judgement under rule 8 of Order 9B of the Civil Procedure Rules. It is also well settled that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that he misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a wrong decision or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the Judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been injustice… The appellant was not altogether free from blame. He could have tried harder to be present at the date of hearing. He delayed considerably in filing his application to set aside the ex parte judgement. The trial Judge’s exasperation at his behaviour was understandable. Although he should not have been precluded from defending the claim against him he has to be penalized to some extent in view of his somewhat dilatory actions.”
The principle that emerges from the above cited cases is that the discretion of a court to set aside or vary ex-parte judgment entered in default of appearance or defence is a free one and is intended to be exercised to avoid injustice or hardship but not to assist a person guilty of deliberate conduct intended to obstruct or delay the course of justice. This was the position that was adopted in Rayat Trading Co. Limited vs Bank of Baroda & Tetezi House Ltd [2018] eKLR where the court listed the matters to be considered in the exercise of this discretion as follows: -i. the defendant has a real prospect of successfully defending the claim; orii.it appears to the court that there is some other good reason why; iii. the judgment should be set aside or varied; or iv. the defendant should be allowed to defend the claim",court,56.28%,model
"Similarly, in the case of, Thorn PLC vs Macdonald [1999] CPLR 660, the Court of Appeal highlighted the following guiding principles: -i. while the length of any delay by the defendant must be taken into account, any pre-action delay is irrelevant; ii. any failure by the defendant to provide a good explanation for the delay is a factor to be taken into account, but is not always a reason to refuse to set aside; iii. the primary considerations are whether there is a defence with a real prospect of success, and that justice should be done; and iv. prejudice (or the absence of it) to the claimant also has to be taken into account.
In the case of Rahman vs Rahman (1999) LTL 26/11/9, the court considered the nature of the discretion to set aside a default judgment and concluded that the elements the judge had to consider were: the nature of the defence, the period of delay (i.e., why the application to set aside had not been made before), any prejudice the claimant was likely to suffer if the default judgment was set aside, and the overriding objective.
In Philip Kiptoo Chemwolo and Mumias Sugar Company Ltd vs Augustine Kubende (1982-1988) KAR, the Court of Appeal held that: -“The court has unlimited discretion to set aside or vary a judgment entered in default of appearance upon such terms as are just in the light of all facts and circumstances both prior and subsequent and of the respective merits of the parties. Kimani -v- MC Conmell (1966) EA 545 where a regular judgment had been entered the court would not usually set aside the judgment unless it was satisfied that there is a triable issue.”
One of the key factors to consider when setting aside an ex-parte judgment is whether the defendant has a defence on merit. In Sebei District Administration vs Gasyali & others (1968) EA 300 Sheridan J. observed that: -“The nature of the action should be considered. The defence if one has been brought to the notice of the court, however irregularly, should be considered, the question as to whether the plaintiff can reasonably be compensated by costs for any delay occasioned should be considered and finally, I think, it should always be remembered that to deny the subject a hearing should be the last resort of the court”",court,56.14%,model
"In the case of, Tree Shade Motor Limited vs DT Dobie Co Ltd CA 38/98, the Court held that even when ex-parte judgment was lawfully entered, the court should look at the draft defence to see if it contains a valid or reasonable defence.
As can be noted from the proceedings, this matter first came to court on 14th November,2018 when the Appellants were not present and a further mention date for 20th February,2019 fixed and again, the Appellants were not present and a hearing date for 16th April,2019 was issued. On the said date, Ms. Wekesa held brief for Mr. Kidiavai, counsel for the Appellant and sought for an adjournment which was objected to but however granted with orders as to costs. Thereafter, a fresh date for hearing was set i.e on 2nd July,2019. On that date, neither the Appellant nor their counsel on record were present in court despite the date having been fixed by consent. The trial court ordered the case to proceed. The Respondent who was present called two witness and closed his case while the Appellant’s case was equally closed. Directions for submissions were taken for 16th July,2019 and thereafter a date for judgment was fixed for 11th September,2019 but the judgment was delivered on 16th October,2019.
Thereafter, the Respondent filed a bill of costs dated 31st October,2019 which was fixed for assessment on 27th November,2019 and the Respondent was ordered to serve the same upon the Appellant. When this matter came up for taxation, the Appellant was absent despite there being proof that they were served and that the court set a date for ruling on the bill of costs for 4th December,2019 when the bill of costs was taxed off at Kshs.513,765/=. On 10th December, 2019 the Appellant came to court with the application which informed the impugned ruling.",court,57.80%,model
"It is imperative to note that the current application was filed on 10th December,2019 after proclamation that was done on 5th December,2019 while judgment was entered on 16th October,2019. Therefore, the current application was filed about two months after entry of Judgment. In my view, I find that a two months delay in filing the application is not only inordinate but has also not been explained by the applicant. This coupled with the fact that counsel for the Appellant was consistently served with notices. I am not persuaded that the appellant has made out a case for the grant of the discretionary orders to set aside the interlocutory judgement entered herein.
My above findings notwithstanding, this court is still minded to exercise its discretion so as to grant the applicant a reprieve by granting them a chance to be heard more so considering the fact that the suit involves a claim for the sum of close to Kshs 4 million which is quite a substantial amount of money. This reprieve will however not be granted without any conditions on the part of the applicant who has clearly been indolent in the handling of its case. My line of thinking is bolstered by the decision in in Rayat Trading Co. Limited vs Bank of Baroda & Tetezi House Ltd [2018] eKLR where the Court held that: -“If the court sets aside a default judgment, it may do so on terms. In most cases, the defaulting defendant will be ordered to pay the claimant’s costs thrown away. In addition, the Court may consider imposing a condition that the defendant must pay a specified sum of money into court to await the final disposal of the claim.”
Further, i agree with the holding of the Supreme Court of India which stated in Sangram Singh vs. Election Tribunal, Koteh, AIR 1955 SC 664, at 711 cited in the case of Gerita Nasipondi Bukunya & 2 others v Attorney General [2019] eKLR that:
“[T]here must be ever present to the mind the fact that our laws of procedure are grounded on a principle of natural justice which requires that men should not be condemned unheard, that decisions should not be reached behind their backs, that proceedings that affect their lives and property should not continue in their absence and that they should not be precluded from participating in them.”",court,56.66%,model
"In Wachira Karani vs. Bildad Wachira (2016) eKLR as was quoted in the case of David Gicheru v Gicheha Farms Limited & another [2020] eKLR the Court held that:-
“The fundamental duty of the Court is to do justice between the parties. It is in turn, fundamental that to that duty, those parties should each be allowed a proper opportunity to put their cases upon the merits of the matter…”
Further, even if the absence of the Appellant was to be blamed on their counsel, as was appreciated by Apalloo, J. A (as then was) in the case of Philip Chemowolo & Another –vs- Augustine Kubede [1982-88] KAR 103 at 1040:
“Blunder will continue to be made from time to time and it does not follow that because a mistake has been made that a party should suffer the penalty of not having his case heard on merit. I think the broad equity approach to this matter is that unless there is fraud or intention to overreach, there is no error or default that cannot be put right by payment of costs. The Court as is often said exists for the purpose of deciding the rights of the parties and not the purpose of imposing discipline.”
In the result, it is my finding that the appeal has merit. The same I allowed. The ruling delivered on 30th April, 2020 in Bungoma CMCC No. 276 of 2018 is hereby set aside and substituted with an order allowing the appellant’s application dated 19thDecember, 2019 with thrown away costs of Kshs 20, 000/ being paid by the appellant to the respondent. Each party to bear their own costs of this appeal.
It is so ordered.

Spent.
That the Honourable court be pleased to enlarge time to allow the Applicant to seek leave to review the judgment of Justice J.O. Olola delivered on 31st August 2021 in ELC Case No. 82 of 2014 at Malindi.

That an order do issue directing the Registrar of Coast Land Titles to restore the title to the suit property in favour of the 3rd Respondent.
That this honourable court do grant any other orders it deems fit and just to grant.
That costs of this suit be provided for.",court,56.39%,model
"That costs of this suit be provided for.
The application is  based on the grounds listed on its face and supported by the affidavit of Radhika Muralee Thayyil dated 24th November 2022, who deponed that sometime in the year 2013, the Applicant entered into an agreement to purchase  land parcel identified as Subdivision No. 5650 (Original No. 24/5) (Vol. No. LT21 Folio B 20A, File 7031) Malindi being part portion of Plot No. 24 (the suit property). 
 That upon payment of the purchase price however, the Applicant was not able to transfer the same as there was a caution registered against the title in ELC Case No. 82 of 2014. As a result, the Applicant filed ELC Case No. 79 of 2017 where judgment was entered on 22nd September 2022 by Olola J. declaring the Applicant a bona fide purchaser for value over the suit property. The learned judge also issued an order for specific performance against the 3rd Respondent.
The Applicant further deponed that her efforts to execute that judgment has been frustrated due to the existence of an earlier judgment in ELC Case No. 82 of 2014 delivered on 31st August 2021 by Olola J. According to her, the Applicant only became aware of that judgment on 10th November 2022 and that the suit property has since been transferred to the 4th Respondent.
She stated that the judgment in ELC No. 82 of 2014 was ripe for review for the following reasons;
The Honourable court in error failed to consider that the statute of limitation had expired as the suit was brought by the 1st Respondent over 17 years from when the cause of action accrued thus directly offending section 7 of the Limitation of Actions Act, Cap 22.",court,56.31%,model
"The Honourable court erred in directing that a new title for the suit property be issued in favour of the 2nd Respondent herein, failing to consider that there was no valid document in the form of a sale agreement in the name of the 2nd respondent brought before the court, to establish that the 2nd Respondent had any stake in the purchase of the property from the previous registered owner, contrary to section 3 (3) of the Law of Contract Act, Cap 23.
The Honourable court erred in relying on inadmissible documents, failing to consider that the only sale agreement produced in court did not pass title to the 2nd Respondent nor did it create beneficial ownership and in any case it was neither signed by all the parties thereto, nor was there attestation as required by section 3(3) of the Law of Contract Act, Cap 23 and section 38 of the Land Act, 2012.
The Honourable court in error relied on an instrument, being sale agreement, not duly stamped for stamp duty contrary to section 19 (1) of the Stamp Duty Act, Cap 480, which states that no instrument chargeable with stamp duty shall be received in any proceedings whatsoever unless it is duly stamped.
The Honourable court failed to take into account that the two suits being ELC 82 of 2014 and ELC 79 OF 2017 ought to have been consolidated before the determination of the former suit as both matters dealt with the same suit property before the same judge.
The Honourable court failed to ensure that the provisions of Order 21 rule 6 were complied with prior to delivery of the judgment in ELC 82 of 2014 being that a certified copy of the title for the suit property ought to have been produced by the Land Registrar before issuance of judgment.
The Honourable Court failed to consider the law of adverse possession and that the 3rd Respondent had been in exclusive possession of the property from 1991 without any protest from the 2nd Respondent as the alleged true owner, being a shareholding director of the 2nd Respondent therefore having access to the financial accounts and asset register of the company.",court,57.14%,model
"The application was opposed by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents who filed grounds of opposition on 13th February 2023 and stated that the application was an afterthought having been filed more than one year since delivery of judgment. That the Application did not raise any sufficient reasons for leave to be granted. 
The Respondents further stated that the application did not meet the threshold for review under Order 45 and that the court did not have jurisdiction to determine the application having pronounced itself on 31st August 2021. The Respondents averred that the Applicant had at one point participated in ELC 82 of 2014 but later withdrew and filed ELC 79 of 2017 to the exclusion of the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents.
The 4th Respondent also filed a replying affidavit dated 9th February 2023 where she deponed that  following the impugned judgment, the suit property was transferred back to the 1st and 2nd Respondents who subsequently transferred the same to her  vide an  indenture dated 5th July 2022  which was registered on 22nd July 2022. She also stated that the 1st Respondent was her biological father. 
The 5th Respondent also opposed the application and stated that the application did not meet the conditions  outlined under Order 45 rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules and the threshold for grant of injunctions hence an abuse of court process.
The 3rd Respondent did not participate in these proceedings.
       APPLICANT’S SUBMISSIONS
Counsel for the Applicant  identified three issues for determination namely:
Whether the Applicant has locus standi to bring this application.
Whether a legal conflict arises by gist of the existence of two conflicting judgments over the same subject matter.
Whether the reliefs sought by the Applicant should be granted.
 On the first issue whether the Applicant has locus standi to file this application, counsel submitted that the simple interpretation of the language used in section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act, and Order 45 of the rules thereunder, was that the right to review extended to any aggrieved party even if they were not parties to a suit of which the Applicant is aggrieved by the Judgment in ELC NO 82 OF 2014.",court,57.22%,model
"Counsel relied on the cases of Accredo Ag and 3 others v Steffano Uccelli and another [2017] eKLR; and Union of India v Nareshkumar Jagad and others v Review Petition C D. No. 40966 of 2013 cited in Civil Appeal No. 7448 of 2011, where the court held that a third party to the proceedings if he considers himself an aggrieved person, may take recourse to the remedy of review.
It was counsel’s further submission  that the grounds highlighted in the application were sufficient to warrant a review of the impugned judgment to ensure that justice is served and that a bad precedent is not set in future proceedings. 
Counsel relied on the cases of   Benjoh Amalgamated Limited and another v Kenya Commercial Bank Limited [2014] eKLR and  Makula International Ltd v His Eminence Cardinal Nsubuga and another [1982] HCB 11. 
Counsel argued that this court was clothed with inherent jurisdiction under Section 3A of the Civil Procedure Act to ensure ends of justice and cited the Supreme Court case of Fredrick Otieno Outa v Jared Odoyo Okello and 3 Others [2017] eKLR.
 Mr. Wahome explained that the review application could not be filed under ELC 82 of 2014 since the Applicant was not a party in that suit, hence the present miscellaneous application. He argued that once a court delivered its judgment, it became functus officio and could not entertain a joinder application and that a joinder application need to  be made in a pending case  and cited the case in Civicon Limited v Kivuwatt Limited and 2 Others [2015] eKLR.",court,55.47%,model
"On the second issue as to whether a legal conflict arises by gist of the existence of two conflicting judgments over the same subject matter, counsel submitted that since the two judgments gave the Applicant in one, and the 1st and 2nd Respondents in another, the same property, it was imperative that the judgment in ELC 82 of 2014 be reviewed. According to counsel, the latter decision, in this case judgment in ELC No. 79 of 2017, ought to be followed and relied on the case of Govinda Naik v West Patent Press Co. Ltd –AIR 1890 Kant 92. Counsel urged the court to allow the application as prayed.
      2ND AND 4TH RESPONDENTS’SUBMISSIONS.
Counsel identified two issues namely- whether the Applicant has locus standi to seek the orders and whether costs should be awarded.
On the first issue, counsel submitted that the Applicant was not a party in ELC No. 82 of 2014 therefore lacked the requisite locus standi to seek the orders sought in the application hence not entitled to review orders. Counsel relied on the case of   Accredo Ag and 3 others v Steffano Uccelli and another (supra)
 Mr. Matheka relied on the case of Isaac Indah Muchesi v Lawrence Gichuru Njenga and 3 Others [2018] eKLR and submitted that the delay of 1 year 3 months in filing the application was inordinate as equity aids the vigilant and not those who slumber on their rights.
Counsel added that the grounds relied upon by the Applicant did  do not meet the threshold  required under Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act and Order 45 rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules and relied on the case of Republic –v- Advocates Disciplinary Tribunal Ex-parte Apollo Mboya [2019] eKLR.
 Mr. Mataheka submitted that the Applicant was not entitled to a temporary injunction since he was not the registered owner of the suit property and further that he has not established a prima facie case. Counsel relied on the case of Nguruman Limited v Jan Bonde Nielsen and 2 Others [2014] eKLR.
        5TH RESPONDENT’S SUBMISSIONS",court,56.02%,model
"5TH RESPONDENT’S SUBMISSIONS
Mr. Munga counsel for the 5th Respondent identified three issues for determination which he generated from the provisions of Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act and Order 45 of the Rules thereunder. The issues were whether the Applicant has established the existence of an error apparent on the face of the judgment; whether the Applicant has established the existence of other sufficient reason; and whether the Applicant filed the application without unreasonable delay. 
Regarding the first issue, counsel quoted the definition of an error apparent on the face of the record as was explained in the case of Republic v Advocates Disciplinary Tribunal Ex parte Apollo Mboya [supra]. Counsel argued that the Applicant’s allegation that the court failed to consider the law on adverse possession was misplaced since adverse possession was never pleaded in ELC No. 82 of 2014 hence there was no error apparent on the face of the record.
On the second issue, Mr. Munga submitted that annexure RMT 4b attached to the applicant’s supporting affidavit was sufficient proof that the Applicant was at all material times aware of the existence of the suit ELC 82 of 2014 and its intended outcome. He argued that the discovery did not amount to new evidence and relied on the case of Alpha Fine Foods Limited v Horeca Kenya Limited and 4 others [2021] eKLR. 
Finally, Mr. Munga submitted that the delay of 15 months to file the application was not explained therefore the application ought to be dismissed on the ground of inordinate delay. Counsel cited that case of   Afapack Entrprises Limited v Punita Jayant Acharya suing as the administrator of the Estate of the late Suchila Anatrai Raval [2018] eKLR where a delay of 9 months from the date the decision was considered inordinate.
        ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION
 The only issue for determination is whether the application as filed is proper before the court or an abuse of court process.
 This is an application for review under Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules and Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act.  Order 45 rule allows any party or a non-party who is aggrieved by a judgment or order of the court to file an application for review.",court,56.86%,model
"Even though the Applicant has locus standi to file an application for review of the Judgment in ELC No 82 of 2014, the right procedure has to be followed. The Applicant ought to have filed the application in ELC CASE NO 82 OF 2014 which he seeks the court to review the judgment.
  Assuming that the court allows the orders sought how arethey going to be implemented. Courts do not give orders in vain. It should be noted that the Applicant was at one point a party in ELC 82 of 2014 but chose to withdraw and file ELC No. 79 of 2017 that he now wants the court to implement as it was in his favour.
 The court will therefore not dwell further on the merits of the application but order that the application is hereby struck out with costs to the Respondents.

The appellant filed the memorandum of appeal dated 04.04.2022 through the firm of C.K Nyabuto Advocates. The appellant appeals against the trial court’s judgment delivered on 10.03.2022 (by Hon. Bernard Kasavuli, the learned trial Magistrate) and upon the grounds that he erred in law and fact by:
Failing to record the proceedings and submissions of the appellant herein.
Failing to take into consideration and appreciating the magnitude of the entire dispute and only selectively dealing with only some issues before the court.
Failing to consider and appreciate the provisions of section 37 of the Employment Act.
Failing to appreciate that the appellant had proved that he was not a casual employee but employed on permanent basis.
Failing to appreciate that the appellant had proved that he was unfairly terminated from employment. 
Misdirecting himself and erred in law and fact by shifting the burden of proof from a balance of probability to proof beyond reasonable doubt, knowing that it is settled law and practice that the burden of proof in civil cases is on a balance of probability and hence disregarding the law and fact that the appellant had proved his case and it was the respondent’s duty to cast doubt on the appellant’s evidence.

The trial Court in its judgment found the appellant had failed to discharge the burden of proof placed on him by dint of the provisions of section 47(5) of the Employment Act, 2007 thus dismissing the claim in its entirety.
Aggrieved by the trial Court’s decision the appellant filed the instant appeal raising the grounds as enumerated in the Amended memorandum of appeal and as further outlined herein above.
As the Court of first appeal, this Court is guided by the findings in the case of Selle vs Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd (1968) EA 123 where the court stated:
“This court must consider the evidence, evaluate itself and draw its own conclusion though in doing so it should   always bear in mind that it neither heard witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect.
However, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he had clearly failed on some point to take account of particular  circumstances or  probabilities  materially  to estimate the evidence  or if  the impression based on the demeanor  of a witness is inconsistent  with  the evidence  in the case  generally (Abdul Hammed  Sarif V Ali Mohammed  Solan [1955] 22 EACA 270).”",court,54.71%,model
"The Court has considered the trial Court’s judgment and the testimonies at the hearing. The trial Court found that the relationship was casual and no more. The trial Court further found that the appellant had failed to provide enough evidence to justify the remedies relied upon. Further, the trial Court found that the appellant had relied upon a NHIF statement which showed that payments had been done for August 2019 to October 2019 and there was no any other document relied upon to prove the long period of service alleged for the appellant. While alleging in his testimony he had signed a contract but copy was not given to him and as submitted for the appellant, there was no pleading in the memorandum of claim that there had been a written contract and there is no notice to produce on record. As found by the trial Court, if indeed the appellant had worked for the entire period as claimed, then why did he not exhibit the NHIF statement for the entire period?  He stated in cross-examination thus, “I agree salary and NHIF are paid at the same time. I did not receive October salary”. The Court finds that by that testimony the claimant was clearly in contradiction with his pleaded case and his witness statement that he was paid on a daily basis at Kshs.600.00 and per paragraph 3 of the memorandum of claim that he was paid salary per day. How then does he claim salary for October, full month? He cannot be trusted in his account. The appellant’s contradictory and incoherent evidence cannot be trusted. The trial Court correctly found that the appellant had failed to establish the employment relationship that would justify the reliefs as were prayed for. The Court finds that the employment was casual and nothing more. The period of service not having been established, what then would be the basis for computing the reliefs prayed for? The Court finds that the trial Court was correct in finding that the relationship being casual and nothing more, it would be superfluous to inquire further as the claims would be based on a finding that the tenure was as long as the claimant had alleged but which was not established at all. All grounds of appeal will collapse. In conclusion the appeal is hereby dismissed with costs and the trial Court’s judgment upheld, and, file be returned to Machakos Sub-Registry forthwith.
Signed, dated and delivered by video-link and in court at Nairobi this Friday 17th November, 2023.
